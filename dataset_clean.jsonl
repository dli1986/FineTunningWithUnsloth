When the by-exp modifier is used, it explodes each value in the attribute and treats each value as though it were a separate item.", "output": "Use by-exp instead of the regular by modifier when you need to sort attributes that contain more than one value (MultiValue attributes) and you want to sort on all values, not just the first one. The regular by modifier only sorts on the first value in a MultiValue attribute and displays each item-ID only once. The by-exp modifier explodes each value in the attribute and treats each value as though it were a separate item, so the item-ID displays multiple times - once for each value in the exploded attribute."}
{"instruction": "How does by-exp affect the display of item-IDs in the output?", "input": "Modifier: by-exp\nDescription: When the by-exp modifier is used, it explodes each value in the attribute and treats each value as though it were a separate item. Each value sorts into its proper position, and the item-ID displays with each value. In other words, the number of times an item-ID displays on a report coincides to the number of values in the exploded attribute.", "output": "When using by-exp, each value in the MultiValue attribute is exploded and treated as a separate item. Each value sorts into its proper position, and the item-ID displays with each value. This means the number of times an item-ID appears on the report corresponds directly to the number of values in the exploded attribute.

Syntax: heading \"{{text} {'options'}...}\"\nOptions include: '' outputs single quote, 'attr.name' inserts attribute value, b inserts break attribute, c centers line, d retrieves date, f{n} inserts filename, j right-justifies, l issues CR/LF, p retrieves page number, t retrieves time/date, and formatting toggles like s/u/v for italics/underline/boldface.", "output": "Use the heading modifier to create custom page headers. The syntax is: heading \"{{text} {'options'}...\". You can include literal text and special options like 'c' to center text, 'd' for current date, 'p' for page number, 't' for time and date, 'l' for line feeds, 'j' for right justification, and formatting options like 's'/'u'/'v' for italics/underline/boldface. Use 'attr.name' to insert attribute values."}
{"instruction": "Can you show me how to create a centered company header with proper spacing?", "input": "Example: list customers heading \"'lc'doolittle enterprises'lc'customer report'l'\" - This heading modifier first issues a line feed, then centers 'doolittle enterprises' on the output device. It then issues another line feed and centers 'customer report' on the next line. The last 'l' forces a blank line between the heading text and the output on the report.", "output": "Here's the example: heading \"'lc'doolittle enterprises'lc'customer report'l'\". This creates a header where: 'l' issues a line feed, 'c' centers 'doolittle enterprises', 'l' adds another line feed, 'c' centers 'customer report' on the next line, and the final 'l' creates a blank line between the heading and the report data."}
{"instruction": "How do I hide the item-IDs from appearing in my AQL report?", "input": "The id-supp modifier suppresses the automatic display of item-IDs in the leftmost column of an AQL report. Syntax: id-supp\nExamples that produce the same output: list entity phone (i, list entity id-supp phone", "output": "Use the id-supp modifier to suppress the automatic display of item-IDs in the leftmost column. Simply add id-supp to your AQL statement: list entity id-supp phone. The equivalent short option is (i."}

Examples that produce the same output: list entity phone (i, list entity id-supp phone", "output": "There is no difference - both (i and id-supp produce identical output. They both suppress the automatic display of item-IDs in the leftmost column of an AQL report. (i is the short option form, while id-supp is the full modifier name."}
{"instruction": "How can I exclude records that don't have a specific attribute value?", "input": "The ifno modifier is the same as indicating with no or with not in an AQL sentence. Syntax: ifno attr.name\nExample: list entity ifno contact", "output": "Use the ifno modifier followed by the attribute name to exclude records that don't have that attribute. For example: list entity ifno contact will list entities that have no contact information. This is equivalent to using 'with no' or 'with not' in an AQL sentence."}
{"instruction": "What does ifno accomplish compared to other selection criteria?", "input": "The ifno modifier is the same as indicating with no or with not in an AQL sentence. Syntax: ifno attr.name\nExample: list entity ifno contact", "output": "The ifno modifier provides a way to select records that lack a specific attribute value, functioning the same as 'with no' or 'with not' selection criteria. It's a shorthand way to filter for records where the specified attribute is empty or null."}
{"instruction": "How do I prevent the legend from appearing in spooled reports?", "input": "The legend-supp modifier suppresses the output of the legend on list and sort operations directed to the spooler. Syntax: legend-supp\nExamples that produce the same output: list-item dm,bp, 'term-type' (k, list-item dm,bp, leg-supp 'term-type', list-item dm,bp, 'term-type' legend-supp", "output": "Use the legend-supp modifier to suppress the legend output on list and sort operations sent to the spooler.

Examples that produce the same output: list-item dm,bp, 'term-type' (k, list-item dm,bp, leg-supp 'term-type', list-item dm,bp, 'term-type' legend-supp", "output": "There are three equivalent ways to suppress legends: use the full modifier name 'legend-supp', the short form 'leg-supp', or the option '(k'. All produce identical results when suppressing legend output on spooled list and sort operations."}
{"instruction": "How can I send my AQL report directly to the printer?", "input": "The lptr modifier directs output of AQL sentences to the system printer, via the spooler. The output is directed according to the options most recently established with the sp-assign command.

The output is directed according to the options most recently established with the sp-assign command. The AQL sentence that created the output is automatically listed at the top of the first page of output, unless otherwise suppressed with the tcl-supp modifier.", "output": "When you use lptr, your AQL output is sent to the system printer through the spooler using the settings from your most recent sp-assign command. The modifier automatically includes the original AQL sentence at the top of the first page (unless you use tcl-supp to suppress it). This provides a printed record of both the query and its results."}
{"instruction": "How do I remove the 'items listed' message from my AQL reports?", "input": "The ni-supp modifier suppresses the number of items listed message at the end of most AQL reports. Syntax: ni-supp\nExamples: list entity phone ni-supp name, list entity phone name (j, list entity phone name (b", "output": "Use the ni-supp modifier to suppress the 'number of items listed' message that normally appears at the end of AQL reports.

All three methods produce the same result by suppressing the 'number of items listed' message at the end of AQL reports."}
{"instruction": "How can I prevent my report from pausing at page breaks?", "input": "The nopage modifier prevents terminal output from pausing at the end of each page. CTRL+X, which terminates a report when the report is paused at a page break, serves no purpose when a report is being produced in nopage mode. It does not stop the report. The only way to stop it is to press the BREAK key and end the process. The equivalent option is n. Syntax: nopage\nExamples: list md nopage, list md a1 (n", "output": "Use the nopage modifier to prevent terminal output from pausing at page breaks. Add nopage to your AQL statement: list md nopage.

{"instruction": "What should I know about stopping reports when using nopage mode?", "input": "The nopage modifier prevents terminal output from pausing at the end of each page. CTRL+X, which terminates a report when the report is paused at a page break, serves no purpose when a report is being produced in nopage mode. It does not stop the report. The only way to stop it is to press the BREAK key and end the process.", "output": "When using nopage mode, the normal CTRL+X command won't stop your report because there are no page pauses where it would normally work. In nopage mode, the only way to stop a running report is to press the BREAK key to end the process entirely. This is important to remember for long-running reports."}
{"instruction": "How do I display only item-IDs without any attribute data?", "input": "The only modifier ignores default attribute-defining items and displays only the item-IDs from the given file reference. The only modifier must precede the file reference. Syntax: command only file.reference {item.list} {selection.criteria} {sort.criteria} {modifiers} {(options)}\nExample: list only entity", "output": "Use the only modifier before the file reference to display only item-IDs, ignoring all default attribute-defining items. The syntax is: command only file.reference. For example: list only entity will show only the entity IDs without any attribute data. Remember that 'only' must come before the file reference."}
{"instruction": "Where should I place the only modifier in my AQL statement?", "input": "The only modifier ignores default attribute-defining items and displays only the item-IDs from the given file reference. The only modifier must precede the file reference. Example: list only entity", "output": "The only modifier must be placed immediately before the file reference in your AQL statement. For example: list only entity. This positioning is required because 'only' modifies how the file reference is processed, ignoring default attribute-defining items to show just the item-IDs."}
{"instruction": "How does roll-on differ from break-on for creating visual breaks in reports?", "input": "The roll-on modifier creates a visual break in output data when the value of a specified attribute changes; an improvement over the break-on command. The roll-on connective is similar to the break-on connective, but has several enhanced features. The attribute values specified by the roll-on connective are rolled into the left adjacent column if data in that column has not been modified by a connective or is not a total column. Unlike the break-on connective, the roll-on connective value automatically displays at the detail break lines.", "output": "Roll-on is an enhanced version of break-on that creates visual breaks when attribute values change. Key differences: roll-on automatically rolls attribute values into adjacent columns when possible (avoiding extra column space), automatically displays the connective value at detail break lines (break-on requires the 'v' option for this), and provides better space utilization by integrating break values into existing columns rather than always creating new ones."}
{"instruction": "What happens to column placement when using roll-on modifier?", "input": "The attribute values specified by the roll-on connective are rolled into the left adjacent column if data in that column has not been modified by a connective (excluding break-on), or is not a total column. If the left adjacent column is a total column or has been modified, the right adjacent column is used if it satisfies the same criteria. If both the left and right adjacent columns have been modified or are total columns, a new column is created.", "output": "Roll-on intelligently places break values using this priority: first, it tries the left adjacent column (if not modified by connectives or a total column); if that's unavailable, it uses the right adjacent column (with same criteria); only if both adjacent columns are modified or total columns does it create a new column. This provides efficient space utilization compared to always creating new columns."}
{"instruction": "Can you show me a practical example of roll-on with page breaks?", "input": "Example: list orders.hist roll-on so# \" 'p'\" inv.line id-supp hdr-supp ni-supp col-hdr-supp tcl-supp (kp - This shows roll-on with the 'p' option to issue a form feed (page eject) after the data associated with this break has been output.", "output": "Here's a practical example: list orders.hist roll-on so# \" 'p'\" inv.line id-supp hdr-supp ni-supp col-hdr-supp tcl-supp (kp. This creates a break on the so# (sales order number) field and uses the 'p' option within the roll-on specification to issue a page break after each sales order's data is output. The other modifiers suppress various default outputs for a cleaner report."}
{"instruction": "How do I limit the number of items processed in my AQL query?", "input": "The sampling modifier limits the number of items processed by the AQL sentence to a specific number. If selection criteria are included within the sentence, processing continues until the specified number of items are found that match the selection criteria. Syntax: sampling sample.number\nExample: select entity sampling 10 resulted in [4042] 10 items selected out of 10 sampling items.", "output": "Use the sampling modifier followed by a number to limit processing: sampling sample.number. For example: select entity sampling 10 will process only 10 items. When selection criteria are included, AQL continues processing until it finds the specified number of items that match your criteria, which may require sampling more items than requested."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between items processed and items sampled with selection criteria?", "input": "If selection criteria are included within the sentence, processing continues until the specified number of items are found that match the selection criteria. Example: select entity with name \"[mary]\" sampling 10 resulted in [4042] 10 items selected out of 1513 sampling items - meaning 1513 items had to be sampled to return the 10 items requested.", "output": "When using selection criteria with sampling, AQL processes items until it finds the requested number that match your criteria. For example, select entity with name \"[mary]\" sampling 10 might show '10 items selected out of 1513 sampling items' - meaning AQL had to examine 1513 total items to find 10 that contained 'mary' in the name field. The sampling count represents items examined, while the selected count represents items that met your criteria."}
{"instruction": "How can I display empty multivalues in my AQL output?", "input": "The show-nulls modifier allows the display of empty multivalues. Syntax: show-nulls\nExample: list entity name contact show-nulls", "output": "Use the show-nulls modifier to display empty multivalues in your output. Add show-nulls to your AQL statement: list entity name contact show-nulls. This modifier makes empty multivalue positions visible rather than hiding them, which can be useful for data analysis or debugging."}
{"instruction": "When would I need to use the show-nulls modifier?", "input": "The show-nulls modifier allows the display of empty multivalues. Example: list entity name contact show-nulls", "output": "Use show-nulls when you need to see empty positions within multivalue fields. This is particularly useful for data analysis, debugging multivalue structure issues, or when you need to understand the complete structure of your multivalue data including gaps or null positions. Without this modifier, empty multivalues are typically hidden from display."}
{"instruction": "How can I create a spreadsheet-style report with columnar totals in AQL?", "input": "The ss (spreadsheet) connective allows printing out AQL reports in spreadsheet format. This is achieved by adding the ss connective to a sort sentence and defining the desired range parameters. The ss modifier produces columnar and cross totals on rows of designated attributes within a given range of dates. Syntax: ss attr.name1{{beg.date} {end.date}} attr.name2{(g}", "output": "Use the ss (spreadsheet) modifier in your AQL sentence. The syntax is 'ss attr.name1{{beg.date} {end.date}} attr.name2{(g}' where attr.name1 contains the date that determines column headings, beg.date and end.date define the date range, and attr.name2 contains the values to be totaled. The ss modifier will create column headings for each possible value of attr.name1 within the date range and total the values from attr.name2 in each column."}
{"instruction": "What determines the granularity of dates displayed when using the ss modifier?", "input": "The granularity of the date display is determined by the output-conversion of the attr.name1. The date granularity is the value of the last multiply in the output-conversion. If the following output-conversion is used to provide week ending dates, the report has a granularity of 7 days and the dates are the Saturday after the date in the item.", "output": "The granularity of the date display in ss modifier reports is determined by the output-conversion of attr.name1 (the date attribute). Specifically, the date granularity equals the value of the last multiply operation in the output-conversion. For example, if you use an output-conversion that provides week ending dates, the report will have a granularity of 7 days with dates showing as the Saturday after the stored date."}
{"instruction": "Show me an example of using the ss modifier with roll-on to create subtotals by category.", "input": "Example: The example below produces a report with subtotals for each code and totals to each category within the code for the quarters 1-04, 2-04, 3-04, and 4-04. list invoices with code \"c\" \"d\" and with amount ne \"\" by code by category ss quarter \"01/01/04\" \"12/31/04\" amount roll-on code roll-on category \"'d'\" det-supp id-supp", "output": "Here's an example that creates a quarterly report with subtotals by code and category: 'list invoices with code \"c\" \"d\" and with amount ne \"\" by code by category ss quarter \"01/01/04\" \"12/31/04\" amount roll-on code roll-on category \"'d'\" det-supp id-supp'. This command will produce a report showing subtotals for each code and totals for each category within the code, with columns for quarters 1-04, 2-04, 3-04, and 4-04, using the roll-on modifier to create the hierarchical subtotals."}
{"instruction": "Can I suppress row and column totals when using the ss modifier?", "input": "Parameter: g - Suppresses the row and column totals.", "output": "Yes, you can suppress row and column totals by adding the 'g' parameter to your ss modifier. Include '(g)' at the end of your ss syntax to eliminate the total rows and columns from the spreadsheet output."}
{"instruction": "Under what circumstances would I use the tape modifier in AQL?", "input": "The tape modifier retrieves data from the currently attached tape, rather than the actual data level of the file. The tape must have been created in a t-dump format and must be positioned to the beginning of the appropriate tape file. The attribute-defining items specified in the AQL sentence are retrieved from the dictionary level of the specified file name.", "output": "Use the tape modifier when you need to retrieve data from a currently attached tape instead of the live file data. This is useful for analyzing archived data or backup copies. The tape must be in t-dump format and positioned at the beginning of the appropriate tape file. The attribute definitions still come from the dictionary of the specified file name, but the actual data is read from the tape."}
{"instruction": "How do I prevent the AQL command from appearing on printed reports?", "input": "The tcl-supp modifier suppresses the display of the AQL (TCL) sentence used to generate the report on printed output only. Example: list entity with phone \"949]\" tcl-supp lptr", "output": "Use the tcl-supp modifier to suppress the display of the AQL sentence on printed output. Simply add 'tcl-supp' to your AQL command. For example: 'list entity with phone \"949]\" tcl-supp lptr' will print the report without showing the command that generated it at the top of the printout."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between using total with and without selection criteria?", "input": "The total modifier accumulates a columnar total for a specified attribute-defining item. Syntax: total attr.name{\"total-limiter\"} or total attr.name{operator} \"value.list\". The total-limiter functions like the value string portion of the selection criteria process, limiting totals to values that pass the specified selection criteria.", "output": "When using the total modifier without selection criteria (total attr.name), it accumulates totals for all values in the specified attribute. When you add selection criteria (total attr.name \"total-limiter\" or total attr.name operator \"value.list\"), it only totals values that meet the specified conditions. For example, 'total amount' totals all amounts, while 'total status \"overdue\"' only totals items where status equals 'overdue'."}
{"instruction": "How does the total modifier work with roll-on modifiers?", "input": "If the total modifier is used in the same sentence as a roll-on, subtotal values are generated whenever a break occurs. The subtotal displays in the appropriate column for each attribute specified in a total modifier. At the end of the listing, a total is generated for each column.", "output": "When you combine total and roll-on modifiers, the system generates subtotal values whenever a break occurs in the roll-on attribute. Each subtotal appears in the appropriate column for every attribute specified with a total modifier. At the end of the complete listing, grand totals are generated for each column, giving you both subtotals by category and overall totals."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to total amounts both above and below certain thresholds.", "input": "Example: list invoices total amount le \"300\" total amount gt \"1000\"", "output": "You can create multiple total columns with different criteria in the same command: 'list invoices total amount le \"300\" total amount gt \"1000\"'. This will create two total columns - one showing the sum of all amounts less than or equal to 300, and another showing the sum of all amounts greater than 1000."}
{"instruction": "When would I need to use the using modifier in AQL?", "input": "The using modifier allows AQL to report on the data in a given file using attribute-defining items from a different file. Only one using connective is allowed in a TCL sentence. Example: In this example, the attribute-defining items name and phone are extracted from the dictionary of the suppliers file, and applied to items in the customers file. list customers using dict suppliers name phone", "output": "Use the using modifier when you need to report on data from one file but want to use attribute definitions from a different file. This is useful when files have similar structures but different dictionaries, or when you want to apply a standardized set of attribute definitions across multiple files. For example, 'list customers using dict suppliers name phone' reports on customer data but uses the name and phone attribute definitions from the suppliers file dictionary."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to negate selection criteria in AQL, and how?", "input": "The with modifier marks the beginning of a selection processor conditional. Parameter: not (or no) - Negates the normal effect of selection. Only those items that do not meet the criteria are selected.", "output": "Yes, you can negate selection criteria using the 'not' or 'no' keywords with the with modifier. When you use 'with not' or 'with no', only items that do NOT meet the specified criteria are selected. For example, 'list entity with no contact' selects only entities that have no contact information, while 'list entity with contact' would select entities that do have contact information."}
{"instruction": "How do I ensure that every value in a MultiValue attribute meets a specific condition?", "input": "Parameter: every (or each) - Specifies that in a MultiValue attribute, every value for the attribute must meet the specified condition. Example: list orders if every quantity.ordered > \"10\"", "output": "Use the 'every' or 'each' keyword with your selection criteria to require that all values in a MultiValue attribute meet the condition. For example, 'list orders if every quantity.ordered > \"10\"' will only select orders where every quantity ordered is greater than 10. Without 'every', the condition would be satisfied if any single value in the MultiValue field meets the criteria."}
{"instruction": "What happens with mask and date conversions when using the with clause?", "input": "Note: When using the with clause, the functionality for mask and date conversions is a bit obscure. If a mask or date conversion exists in the output-conversion, that conversion is applied to the selection criteria in the AQL sentence. For example, in the sentence: select filename with attr \"90]\" Where the data contains such values as 9000, 9010, 9020, and so on, the \"90]\" gets converted by an MR2 to \"9000]\". The logic is to convert the selection criteria once, rather than to convert each value that is processed by the select.", "output": "When using the with clause, mask and date conversions in the output-conversion are applied to your selection criteria, not to each data value during processing. For example, if you have 'select filename with attr \"90]\"' and an MR2 conversion exists, the \"90]\" in your criteria gets converted to \"9000]\" once before processing begins. This is more efficient than converting each data value (9000, 9010, 9020, etc.) during selection. To avoid this behavior, move the conversion code to the correlative attribute instead of the output-conversion."}
{"instruction": "How can I explode hierarchical data structures like bill-of-materials using AQL?", "input": "The within modifier retrieves a list of all the items that are subitems of a specified item. This is used to explode one attribute containing one or more MultiValues that are item-IDs within the same file, like in bill-of-material explosions. The file-defining item (D-pointer) must contain a v code in attribute 8 in the form: v;;n where n indicates the attribute count to explode. The explosion may proceed up to 20 sublevels.", "output": "Use the within modifier to explode hierarchical structures like bills of materials. The syntax is 'list within file.reference 'item-ID''. Your file's D-pointer must have a 'v;;n' code in attribute 8, where n specifies which attribute contains the sub-item IDs. For example, 'list within parts 'car'' will explode all components of a car item, showing up to 20 levels of sub-assemblies and parts in a hierarchical listing."}
{"instruction": "Show me what the output looks like when using the within modifier for a bill-of-materials explosion.", "input": "Example: list within parts 'car' produces the output: level Parts... 1 car 2 engine 2 wheel 3 tire 3 rim 2 hood [405] 6 items listed out of 1 items.", "output": "When you use 'list within parts 'car'', the output shows a hierarchical structure with level numbers indicating the depth of each component: 'level Parts... 1 car 2 engine 2 wheel 3 tire 3 rim 2 hood [405] 6 items listed out of 1 items.' Level 1 is the main item (car), level 2 shows direct components (engine, wheel, hood), and level 3 shows sub-components (tire and rim under wheel). The explosion continues until all sub-levels are displayed or the 20-level limit is reached."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between 'without', 'with no', and 'if no' in AQL selection?", "input": "The without modifier negates the normal rules for selection criteria. if no, with no, and with not are identical to without. Example: This is essentially the same as with no phone. list entity without phone. It could also be stated as: list entity with phone = \"\"", "output": "The modifiers 'without', 'with no', 'if no', and 'with not' are all identical and negate normal selection criteria. For example, 'list entity without phone', 'list entity with no phone', and 'list entity if no phone' all produce the same result - selecting entities that have no phone number. This is equivalent to 'list entity with phone = \"\"' which explicitly tests for empty phone fields."}
{"instruction": "How do I select records where an attribute value comes after a specific value alphabetically?", "input": "The after relational operator represents a greater than condition used in constructing selection clauses. The gt and > operators perform the same function. Example: list customers with name after \"c\"", "output": "Use the 'after' operator (or its equivalents 'gt' and '>') to select records where an attribute value is alphabetically or numerically greater than your specified value. For example, 'list customers with name after \"c\"' selects all customers whose names start with letters that come after 'c' in the alphabet (d, e, f, etc.). This works the same as 'list customers with name gt \"c\"' or 'list customers with name > \"c\"'."}
{"instruction": "Can I combine multiple selection criteria with logical operators in a single AQL command?", "input": "The and clause is used between selection criteria clauses to indicate that both condition being evaluated as true selects the item for processing. Example: This example lists those items that meet one of two criteria: a name starting with ar and with a city starting with irv, or, a city starting with san and a contact containing the string joe. list entity with name \"ar]\" and with city \"irv]\" or with city \"san]\" and with contact \"[joe]\"", "output": "Yes, you can combine multiple selection criteria using 'and' and 'or' logical operators. The 'and' clause requires both conditions to be true, while 'or' allows either condition to be true. For example: 'list entity with name \"ar]\" and with city \"irv]\" or with city \"san]\" and with contact \"[joe]\"' selects items that either (have names starting with 'ar' AND cities starting with 'irv') OR (have cities starting with 'san' AND contacts containing 'joe'). The logical precedence follows standard rules where 'and' operations are evaluated before 'or' operations."}
{"instruction": "What's the behavior difference between 'before', 'lt', and '<' operators in AQL?", "input": "The before relational operator represents a less than condition used in constructing selection clauses. The < and lt operators perform the same function as before. Example: list employees with birthday before \"1/1/72\"", "output": "The 'before', 'lt', and '<' operators are functionally identical - they all represent a 'less than' condition in selection clauses. You can use whichever syntax you prefer. For example, 'list employees with birthday before \"1/1/72\"', 'list employees with birthday lt \"1/1/72\"', and 'list employees with birthday < \"1/1/72\"' all produce the same result, selecting employees with birthdays before January 1, 1972."}
{"instruction": "Why might the equal operator behave unexpectedly with null values when using mt processing codes?", "input": "Note: When using an ADI with an mt processing code, a null value is converted to zero before testing for equality or inequality. Therefore, ADI = \"\" will find nothing and ADI # \"\" will return everything. This only affects \"equal\" or \"not equal\". \"Less than or equal\", \"Greater than or equal\" and others are not affected.", "output": "When using an attribute-defining item (ADI) with an 'mt' processing code, null values are automatically converted to zero before equality testing. This means 'ADI = \"\"' (testing for empty/null) will find nothing because nulls become zeros, and 'ADI # \"\"' (not equal to empty) will return everything since all values are either numbers or zeros. This conversion only affects equality ('=' and '#') operators - comparison operators like '<=', '>=', '<', and '>' are not affected by this null-to-zero conversion."}
{"instruction": "How do I select items where a numeric field is greater than or equal to a threshold value?", "input": "The ge relational operator represents a greater than or equal to condition used in constructing selection clauses. Example: list invoices with amount ge \"0\", list invoices with amount >= \"0\"", "output": "Use the 'ge' operator or its equivalent '>=' to select items where a numeric field is greater than or equal to your threshold. For example, 'list invoices with amount ge \"0\"' or 'list invoices with amount >= \"0\"' will select all invoices with amounts of zero or greater. Both syntax forms produce identical results."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between 'le' and 'lt' operators when filtering numeric data?", "input": "The le operator selects items whose specified attribute name contains a value less than or equal to the specified value string. Example: select invoices with amount.due le \"0\". The lt operator selects items whose specified attribute name contains a value less than the specified value string. Example: select invoices with amount.due lt \"0\"", "output": "The 'le' operator selects values less than OR EQUAL to your specified value, while 'lt' selects values strictly less than (not including equal). For example, 'select invoices with amount.due le \"0\"' includes invoices with exactly zero balance plus any negative balances, whereas 'select invoices with amount.due lt \"0\"' only includes negative balances and excludes zero balances. Use 'le' when you want to include the boundary value, and 'lt' when you want to exclude it."}
{"instruction": "How do I select items where an attribute value is not equal to a specific string?", "input": "Syntax: with attr.name ne \"valuestring\"\nDescription: The ne operator selects items whose specified attribute name contains a value not equal to the specified value string.\nExample: select invoices with amount.due ne \"0\"", "output": "Use the 'ne' operator in your selection criteria. The syntax is 'with attr.name ne \"valuestring\"'. For example, to select all invoices where the amount due is not equal to zero, you would use: select invoices with amount.due ne \"0\". You can also use the '#' symbol as an alternative: select invoices with amount.due # \"0\". Note that when using an ADI with processing code, null values are converted to zero before testing for equality or inequality."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between the ne operator and other inequality operators in selection criteria?", "input": "Syntax: with attr.name ne \"valuestring\"\nDescription: The ne operator selects items whose specified attribute name contains a value not equal to the specified value string.\nNote: When using an ADI with processing code, a null value is converted to zero before testing for equality or inequality. Therefore, ADI = \"\" will find nothing and ADI # \"\" will return everything. This only affects \"equal\" or \"not equal\". \"Less than or equal\", \"Greater than or equal\" and others are not affected.", "output": "The 'ne' operator specifically tests for inequality (not equal to). Unlike other comparison operators like 'less than or equal' or 'greater than or equal', the 'ne' operator has special behavior with null values when used with ADI processing codes. Null values are converted to zero before testing, so ADI = \"\" finds nothing while ADI # \"\" returns everything. This null-to-zero conversion only affects equality and inequality operators, not other comparison operators."}
{"instruction": "Can you show me alternative ways to express 'not equal' in selection statements?", "input": "Syntax: with attr.name ne \"valuestring\"\nDescription: The ne operator selects items whose specified attribute name contains a value not equal to the specified value string.\nExample: select invoices with amount.due ne \"0\", select invoices with amount.due # \"0\"", "output": "Yes, there are multiple ways to express 'not equal' in selection statements. You can use 'ne', '#', 'no', or 'not' operators. For example: 'select invoices with amount.due ne \"0\"' or 'select invoices with amount.due # \"0\"' both accomplish the same result. All these operators perform the same function of selecting items where the specified attribute value is not equal to the given value."}
{"instruction": "Under what circumstances should I be careful when using the ne operator with empty values?", "input": "Note: When using an ADI with processing code, a null value is converted to zero before testing for equality or inequality. Therefore, ADI = \"\" will find nothing and ADI # \"\" will return everything. This only affects \"equal\" or \"not equal\". \"Less than or equal\", \"Greater than or equal\" and others are not affected.", "output": "Be careful when using the 'ne' operator with ADI (Attribute Defining Items) that have processing codes, especially with empty or null values. When an ADI has a processing code, null values are automatically converted to zero before the equality/inequality test is performed. This means that testing ADI = \"\" (equal to empty string) will find nothing, while ADI # \"\" or ADI ne \"\" (not equal to empty string) will return everything. This conversion behavior only affects equality and inequality operators - other comparison operators like 'less than or equal' or 'greater than or equal' are not affected by this null-to-zero conversion."}
{"instruction": "How does the 'not' operator work in conditional statements and what are its alternatives?", "input": "Syntax: if not {each} attr.name{operator} {\"value\"}\nDescription: The not operator represents a not equal to condition. This reverses the true sense of the condition in a selection criteria. The #, no, and ne operators perform the same function as not.\nExample: list jobs if not stat = \"c\", list jobs if stat not \"c\"", "output": "The 'not' operator reverses the true sense of a condition in selection criteria. It can be used in conditional statements with the syntax 'if not {each} attr.name{operator} {\"value\"}'. For example, 'list jobs if not stat = \"c\"' lists all jobs where the status is not equal to 'c'. You can also write this as 'list jobs if stat not \"c\"'. The 'not' operator performs the same function as the '#', 'no', and 'ne' operators - they all represent inequality conditions."}
{"instruction": "What are the different ways to express negation in job listing commands?", "input": "Syntax: if not {each} attr.name{operator} {\"value\"}\nDescription: The not operator represents a not equal to condition. This reverses the true sense of the condition in a selection criteria. The #, no, and ne operators perform the same function as not.\nExample: list jobs if not stat = \"c\", list jobs if stat not \"c\"", "output": "There are several ways to express negation in job listing commands. You can use 'if not stat = \"c\"' or 'if stat not \"c\"' - both accomplish the same result. The 'not' operator can be placed either before the entire condition or after the attribute name. Additionally, you can use alternative operators like '#', 'no', and 'ne' which all perform the same function as 'not' for expressing inequality conditions."}
{"instruction": "When would I use multiple selection criteria connected with 'or' clauses?", "input": "Syntax: with clause or with clause\nDescription: The or clause is used between selection criteria clauses to indicate that either condition being evaluated as true selects the item for processing.\nExample: list entity with name \"ar]\" and with city \"irv]\" or with city \"san]\" and with contact \"[joe]\"", "output": "Use 'or' clauses when you want to select items that meet any one of multiple different criteria sets. The 'or' clause indicates that if either condition evaluates as true, the item will be selected for processing. For example, 'list entity with name \"ar]\" and with city \"irv]\" or with city \"san]\" and with contact \"[joe]\"' will select entities that either: (have a name starting with 'ar' AND a city starting with 'irv') OR (have a city starting with 'san' AND a contact containing 'joe'). This allows you to create complex selection logic where items can qualify through different paths."}
{"instruction": "How do I structure complex selection criteria that combine multiple conditions?", "input": "Syntax: with clause or with clause\nDescription: The or clause is used between selection criteria clauses to indicate that either condition being evaluated as true selects the item for processing.\nExample: This example lists those items that meet one of two criteria: a name starting with ar and with a city starting with irv, or, a city starting with san and a contact containing the string joe. list entity with name \"ar]\" and with city \"irv]\" or with city \"san]\" and with contact \"[joe]\"", "output": "Structure complex selection criteria by combining 'and' and 'or' clauses to create logical groupings. Use 'and' to require multiple conditions within a group, and 'or' to provide alternative qualifying paths. In the example 'list entity with name \"ar]\" and with city \"irv]\" or with city \"san]\" and with contact \"[joe]\"', there are two distinct criteria groups: the first group requires both name starting with 'ar' AND city starting with 'irv', while the second group requires both city starting with 'san' AND contact containing 'joe'. An entity will be selected if it meets either complete group of conditions."}
{"instruction": "What does the u5070 user exit function do to input strings?", "input": "Syntax: u5070, string\nDescription: The u5070 user exit converts a string to the form: string[1,3]: \"-000\". It strips all but the first three characters, and then appends the literal -000 to the end. If the string is less than three characters long, then it is returned untouched.\nExample: string = \"abcdef\", u5070,string returns \"abc-000\"", "output": "The u5070 user exit function transforms strings by taking only the first three characters and appending '-000' to the end. For example, if you have string = \"abcdef\" and apply u5070,string, it returns \"abc-000\". The function strips all characters beyond the first three and adds the literal string '-000'. However, if the input string is less than three characters long, it is returned unchanged without any modification."}
{"instruction": "Under what conditions does u5070 leave a string unmodified?", "input": "Description: The u5070 user exit converts a string to the form: string[1,3]: \"-000\". It strips all but the first three characters, and then appends the literal -000 to the end. If the string is less than three characters long, then it is returned untouched.", "output": "The u5070 user exit leaves a string unmodified when the input string is less than three characters long. In this case, the string is returned exactly as it was input, without any truncation or appending of '-000'. Only strings with three or more characters are processed by taking the first three characters and adding '-000' to the end."}
{"instruction": "How do I retrieve a specific value from a MultiValue set using user exits?", "input": "Syntax: uc070; n\nDescription: The uc070 user exit returns the specified value from a MultiValue set.\nParameter: n - Value count to return\nExample: uc070;3", "output": "Use the uc070 user exit with the syntax 'uc070; n' where 'n' is the value count you want to return from a MultiValue set. For example, 'uc070;3' returns the third value from the MultiValue set. The parameter 'n' specifies which value position to extract from the set, allowing you to access specific elements within MultiValue data structures."}
{"instruction": "What parameter does uc070 require and what does it represent?", "input": "Syntax: uc070; n\nDescription: The uc070 user exit returns the specified value from a MultiValue set.\nParameter: n - Value count to return", "output": "The uc070 user exit requires one parameter: 'n', which represents the value count to return. This parameter specifies the position number of the value you want to extract from a MultiValue set. The 'n' parameter acts as an index to identify which specific value within the MultiValue structure should be returned by the function."}
{"instruction": "How do attribute references with asterisks work in selection criteria?", "input": "Syntax: *a n{*a n...}\nDescription: The number in the item-ID corresponds to the attribute mark that it describes.\nExample: list md with *a1 = \"d]\", list mds,, with a1 = \"d]\" and with *a8 = \"sys]\"", "output": "Attribute references with asterisks (*a) work by directly referencing specific attribute positions, where the number corresponds to the attribute mark being described. For example, '*a1' refers to the first attribute, '*a8' refers to the eighth attribute, and so on. You can use these in selection criteria like 'list md with *a1 = \"d]\"' to find items where the first attribute equals 'd]', or combine multiple conditions like 'list mds,, with a1 = \"d]\" and with *a8 = \"sys]\"' to match multiple attribute criteria simultaneously."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between using 'a' and '*a' notation in attribute references?", "input": "Syntax: *a n{*a n...} and an {an...}\nDescription: The number in the item-ID corresponds to the attribute mark that it describes.\nExample: list md with *a1 = \"d]\", list md with a1 = \"d]\", list mds,, with a1 = \"d]\" and with *a8 = \"sys]\"", "output": "Both 'a' and '*a' notation reference the same attribute positions - the number corresponds to the attribute mark being described. You can use either 'list md with *a1 = \"d]\"' or 'list md with a1 = \"d]\"' to achieve the same result of selecting items where the first attribute equals 'd]'. The '*a' form is simply an alternative syntax for the standard 'a' notation, and both can be used interchangeably in selection criteria and attribute references."}
{"instruction": "How can I determine the frame count composition of compiled programs?", "input": "Syntax: command dict file.reference {item.list} c/total {(options)}\nDescription: Displays the total number of frames that make up a binary item. The frame count is divided into two parts, the number frames of: D3 object code, FlashBASIC object code. It is used by AQL and list-obj to add together attributes 3 and 12 of compiled date-time stamps.\nExample: list dict bp c/total", "output": "Use the 'c/total' option with list commands to display the total number of frames that make up a binary item. The syntax is 'command dict file.reference {item.list} c/total {(options)}'. For example, 'list dict bp c/total' shows the frame count divided into D3 object code frames and FlashBASIC object code frames. This is particularly useful with AQL and list-obj commands as it adds together attributes 3 and 12 of compiled date-time stamps to provide the total frame count information."}
{"instruction": "What information does c/total provide about compiled programs and how is it calculated?", "input": "Description: Displays the total number of frames that make up a binary item. The frame count is divided into two parts, the number frames of: D3 object code, FlashBASIC object code. It is used by AQL and list-obj to add together attributes 3 and 12 of compiled date-time stamps.\nExample: dict bp........frames, test 1, test2 4*. Note: The asterisk indicates that this program has been compiled with FlashBASIC.", "output": "The c/total option provides detailed information about the frame composition of compiled programs by showing the total number of frames divided into two categories: D3 object code frames and FlashBASIC object code frames. It calculates this by adding together attributes 3 and 12 of compiled date-time stamps. In the output, programs compiled with FlashBASIC are marked with an asterisk (*). For example, if you see 'test2 4*', this indicates the program 'test2' uses 4 frames and was compiled with FlashBASIC, while 'test 1' shows a program using 1 frame compiled with D3 object code."}
{"instruction": "How do I terminate processes on different ports using the end command?", "input": "Syntax: end {port.number user-ID}\nDescription: The end command terminates a process on another port, or the current port if a port number is not specified. The end command can also be used to stop a TCL command that was sent to another line by the tcl command, or to terminate a phantom job. The end command clears an active list and requires a sys2 privilege level.\nExample: end (ends current process), end 16 dm (stops process on line 16 under user-ID dm)", "output": "Use the 'end' command with optional port number and user-ID to terminate processes. The syntax is 'end {port.number user-ID}'. To end the current process, simply use 'end'. To terminate a process on another port, specify the port number and user-ID, like 'end 16 dm' which stops the process executing on line 16 under the user-ID 'dm'. The end command requires sys2 privilege level and can also terminate phantom jobs or stop TCL commands sent to other lines. Note that it clears any active list in the process."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I use the end command with an active list?", "input": "Description: The end command stops processing at the previous level and returns to the preceding level TCL prompt. However, if there is an active list at the current level, then list is cleared, and control is not returned to the previous level. The end command clears an active list and requires a sys2 privilege level.\nExample: select dict entity[404] 276 items selected out of 276 items.end", "output": "When you use the 'end' command with an active list, the list is cleared but control is NOT returned to the previous level. Normally, the end command would return you to the preceding level TCL prompt, but the presence of an active list changes this behavior. As shown in the example, after selecting 276 items with 'select dict entity[404]', using 'end' will clear this active list. The end command always clears active lists and requires sys2 privilege level to execute."}
{"instruction": "What are the different options available when starting phantom jobs with the z command?", "input": "Syntax: z {h}{s}{d} {tcl.command}\nDescription: The z command starts a phantom job. Phantom jobs run in the background, meaning that they do not necessarily need a terminal present.\nParameters: h - holds all terminal output in a D3 spooler file hold entry and suppresses output to the terminal; s - suppresses error messages; d - deletes the phantom job item from the jobs file after completion", "output": "The z command offers three main options that can be combined: 'h' holds all terminal output in a D3 spooler file and suppresses terminal output, 's' suppresses error messages (otherwise they display on the originating terminal), and 'd' deletes the phantom job item from the jobs file after completion (unless the process aborts or gets logged off). You can combine these options like 'zhsd', 'zhd', or 'zd', but certain combinations like 'zshd' or 'zdh' are not allowed. Each option modifies how the phantom process handles output, errors, and cleanup."}
{"instruction": "How does the phantom job submission process work when no TCL command is specified?", "input": "Description: If a TCL command is specified, no further prompting occurs, and the job is submitted using all the default values. If a TCL command is not specified, it prompts for: user-id, md id, tcl command, line, input data.\nExample: z user-id (<cr>=kim): md id (<cr>=ref): command: compile bp process.see.also", "output": "When no TCL command is specified with the z command, the system prompts you for several parameters in sequence: user-id (defaults to current user-ID, requires password if different from DM user), md id (defaults to current master dictionary, requires account password if specified), tcl command (the initial TCL statement to execute), line (port number for the process, uses phantom line if not specified), and input data (additional commands for the phantom process, terminated by pressing Enter). Each prompt shows the default value in parentheses, and you can press Enter to accept defaults. The process is released to the phantom scheduler after all prompts are completed."}
{"instruction": "What's the proper way to stack input data for phantom processes?", "input": "Parameter: input data - Designates input data to be stacked for use by the phantom process. Each separate string must be terminated by pressing Enter. A null response can be stacked by pressing CTRL+N, Enter. Pressing Enter at the input data: prompt indicates that all commands have been entered and the process is then released to the phantom scheduler.\nExample: Press CTRL+N, Enter, to enter null data.", "output": "Stack input data for phantom processes by entering each separate string and terminating it with Enter. To stack a null response, press CTRL+N followed by Enter. When you're finished entering all commands, press Enter at the 'input data:' prompt to indicate completion - this releases the process to the phantom scheduler. Each command or data string must be entered on a separate line, and the CTRL+N, Enter combination allows you to explicitly stack null data when needed by the phantom process."}
{"instruction": "How do I reference specific elements in dimensioned versus dynamic arrays?", "input": "Syntax: dim.array.var(element.exp), dim.array.var(row.num,col.num), dyn.array.var<ac.exp>, dyn.array.var<ac.exp, vc.exp>, dyn.array.var<ac.exp, vc.exp, sc.exp>\nDescription: Dimensioned arrays have a maximum of two dimensions and must first be defined with a dim or dimension statement. Dynamic (or string) array references use angle brackets.\nExample: customer.item(1) = name, customer.item<2,2> = address2", "output": "Dimensioned arrays use parentheses and can have one or two dimensions: 'dim.array.var(element.exp)' for single dimension or 'dim.array.var(row.num,col.num)' for two dimensions. Dynamic arrays use angle brackets with up to three levels: 'dyn.array.var<ac.exp>' for attributes, 'dyn.array.var<ac.exp, vc.exp>' for values within attributes, and 'dyn.array.var<ac.exp, vc.exp, sc.exp>' for subvalues. For example, 'customer.item(1) = name' assigns to the first element of a dimensioned array, while 'customer.item<2,2> = address2' assigns to the second value in the second attribute of a dynamic array."}
{"instruction": "When working with file statements, how can I reference dimensioned array elements by item-ID?", "input": "Description: When used in conjunction with the file statement, dimensioned array elements can be referenced by the actual item-ID of the attribute-defining item in the associated dictionary. A specific value or subvalue of a dimensioned array can be specified using these forms: dim.array.var(element.exp)<ac.exp, vc.exp, sc.exp>", "output": "When using dimensioned arrays with file statements, you can reference array elements directly by the actual item-ID of the attribute-defining item in the associated dictionary. This allows you to use meaningful dictionary item names instead of numeric positions. You can also specify particular values or subvalues within dimensioned array elements using the form 'dim.array.var(element.exp)<ac.exp, vc.exp, sc.exp>', where ac.exp references the attribute, vc.exp the value count, and sc.exp the subvalue within that dimensioned array element."}
{"instruction": "What are the different ways to test for empty or null values in dynamic arrays?", "input": "Example: if customer.item<2,vc.exp> = \"\" then..., if customer.item<2,*> = \"\" then..., if customer.item<*,*,*> = \"\" then...\nDescription: Tests for specific values, any value in an attribute, or any value anywhere in the array equal to null string.", "output": "There are several ways to test for empty values in dynamic arrays using wildcard patterns: 'if customer.item<2,vc.exp> = \"\" then...' tests a specific value in attribute 2, 'if customer.item<2,*> = \"\" then...' tests for any empty value within attribute 2, and 'if customer.item<*,*,*> = \"\" then...' tests for any empty subvalue in any value in any attribute throughout the entire array. The asterisk (*) serves as a wildcard to check multiple positions simultaneously, allowing you to efficiently locate empty values at different levels of the array structure."}
{"instruction": "How does variable assignment work with different types of array elements and substrings?", "input": "Syntax: variable = expression\nDescription: The variable can be a simple variable, an array element, a dynamic array element, a substring, or all of the above.\nExample: item<-1> = code (adds as last attribute), item<codes,-1> = code (adds as last value), item<1,2,2> = \"100\" (replaces subvalue), string[3,2] = \"ca\" (replaces character positions)", "output": "Variable assignment works with multiple data structure types. You can assign to simple variables, array elements, dynamic array elements, and substrings. Special notations include: 'item<-1> = code' adds the value as the last attribute, 'item<codes,-1> = code' adds as the last value in a specific attribute, 'item<1,2,2> = \"100\"' replaces the second subvalue in the second value of the first attribute, and 'string[3,2] = \"ca\"' replaces characters at positions 3 and 4. You can even combine these approaches, like 'item<1,2,1>[3,2] = \"ca\"' which replaces character positions within a specific array element."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between adding values to the end of attributes versus adding new attributes?", "input": "Example: item<-1> = code (adds the value of code as the last attribute of the dynamic array item), item<codes,-1> = code (adds the value of code as the last value in an attribute of codes)\nDescription: Assignment examples showing different ways to append data to dynamic arrays.", "output": "The key difference is in what gets appended and where: 'item<-1> = code' adds the value as a completely new attribute at the end of the dynamic array, creating a new attribute position. In contrast, 'item<codes,-1> = code' adds the value as the last value within an existing attribute called 'codes', extending that specific attribute's value list rather than creating a new attribute. The first form increases the number of attributes in the array, while the second form increases the number of values within a specific existing attribute."}
{"instruction": "How do I use conversion expressions with both literal processing codes and variable codes?", "input": "Syntax: iconv(str.exp, conv.exp), oconv(str.exp, conv.exp)\nDescription: A conversion expression is any function that evaluates to a valid processing code (conversion).\nExample: print oconv(time(),'mth'), conv.exp = 'd2-', d = oconv(date(),conv.exp)", "output": "Conversion expressions can use both literal processing codes and variable-stored codes. For literal codes, use the processing code directly in quotes like 'print oconv(time(),\"mth\")' which uses the 'mth' processing code as a literal string. For variable codes, store the processing code in a variable first: 'conv.exp = \"d2-\"' then use it in the conversion: 'd = oconv(date(),conv.exp)'. You can also build complex conversion codes by concatenating strings, such as 'money = oconv(income,\"mr\":preci:scale)' where the final conversion expression becomes the compound string 'mr24' when preci='2' and scale='4'."}
{"instruction": "What's the purpose of iconv versus oconv in conversion expressions?", "input": "Syntax: iconv(str.exp, conv.exp), oconv(str.exp, conv.exp)\nDescription: A conversion expression is any function that evaluates to a valid processing code (conversion).", "output": "Both iconv and oconv are conversion functions that apply processing codes to string expressions, but they serve different purposes: iconv performs input conversion (typically converting external format data to internal format), while oconv performs output conversion (converting internal format data to external format for display or output). Both use the same syntax pattern of function(string_expression, conversion_expression) where the conversion expression can be a literal processing code or a variable containing the processing code."}
{"instruction": "After opening a file, what statements can I use with the file variable?", "input": "Description: A file variable contains the assigned file pointers and are used by subsequent BASIC file input and output statements. After explicitly assigned, using these statements references the given file by its file variable: clearfile, delete, matread, matreadu, matwrite, matwriteu, open, read, readu, readv, readvu, release, select, write, writev, writevu\nExample: open \"invoices\" to inv.f else..., readu item from inv.f,\"cust.345\" else...", "output": "After opening a file to a file variable, you can use these BASIC statements with it: clearfile, delete, matread, matreadu, matwrite, matwriteu, open, read, readu, readv, readvu, release, select, write, writev, and writevu. For example, after 'open \"invoices\" to inv.f else...', you can use 'readu item from inv.f,\"cust.345\" else...' to read an item from the invoices file. The file variable (inv.f in this case) serves as the symbolic reference to the opened file for all subsequent file operations."}
{"instruction": "What are the limitations of file variables compared to other variable types?", "input": "Description: Unlike numeric and string variables, a file variable cannot be output with a print or crt statement, used in a string or arithmetic expression, or displayed in the FlashBASIC or BASIC debugger. A file variable can be assigned to other variables in a standard assignment statement or copied to other variables.\nExample: open \"invoices\" to inv.f else...", "output": "File variables have several limitations compared to numeric and string variables: they cannot be output with print or crt statements, cannot be used in string or arithmetic expressions, and cannot be displayed in the FlashBASIC or BASIC debugger. However, file variables can be assigned to other variables using standard assignment statements, allowing you to copy the file pointer to other variables. Their primary purpose is to serve as symbolic references to opened files for file I/O operations, not for general data manipulation or display."}
{"instruction": "Where can functions be used within BASIC programs and how do they integrate with expressions?", "input": "Syntax: function({argument{,argument{,..}}})\nDescription: Functions are elements in BASIC language expressions, returning a single value in place, as a function of the arguments. A function can be used anywhere a variable or expression is used.\nExample: int.date=iconv(ext.date,\"d\"), if data='' then kc=1 else kc=dcount(data,am)", "output": "Functions can be used anywhere a variable or expression is used within BASIC programs. They integrate seamlessly into expressions by returning a single value in place based on their arguments. For example, 'int.date=iconv(ext.date,\"d\")' uses the iconv function within an assignment statement to convert a date, and 'if data='' then kc=1 else kc=dcount(data,am)' uses the dcount function within a conditional expression to count delimited values. Functions accept zero or more arguments separated by commas and can be nested within other expressions or function calls."}
{"instruction": "How does global common space work across different program levels and processes?", "input": "Syntax: common /ID/variable|array{,variable|array...}\nDescription: Global common is a named BASIC variable space used to store variables and arrays in the identified area that is only initialized at logon. Global common space is common for all levels of the same process (that is, level pushes, executes, file-time bridges & indexes, and so on).\nExample: common /person/ name, company", "output": "Global common space creates a named variable area that persists across all levels of the same process, including level pushes, executes, file-time bridges, and indexes. It's initialized only once at logon and provides interprogram communication capabilities. For example, 'common /person/ name, company' creates a global common area named 'person' containing the variables 'name' and 'company'. These variables can be accessed and modified by any program or subroutine within the same process, allowing data to be shared between different program levels without having to pass parameters explicitly."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between global common and regular variables in terms of scope and initialization?", "input": "Description: Global common is a named BASIC variable space used to store variables and arrays in the identified area that is only initialized at logon. Variables and/or arrays can be used for communication between programs and subroutines providing interprogram communication.\nExample: common /person/ name, company", "output": "Global common variables differ significantly from regular variables in scope and initialization. Regular variables are local to their program and are reinitialized each time the program runs. Global common variables are stored in a named space that is initialized only once at logon and persists across all program levels within the same process. This makes global common ideal for interprogram communication, as programs and subroutines can share data through the common area without losing values between program executions. The named identifier (like '/person/' in the example) allows different programs to access the same shared variable space."}
{"instruction": "How do I format numeric values with specific alignment and precision in BASIC?", "input": "Masking is the process of formatting expressions using numeric masks and format masks. Syntax: str.exp mask.exp\nParameters: {r|l|d{n}{s}{z}{,}{c}{$}({{{f},l}...})\nr|l|d specifies right-(r) or left-(l) aligned. The default is left.\nn is number of digits after decimal point\ns is scaling factor\nz suppresses leading zeros\n, inserts commas between every thousands position\nc is sign code for negative values\n$ appends dollar sign", "output": "Use the masking syntax with str.exp mask.exp format. For alignment, use 'r' for right-aligned or 'l' for left-aligned (default). For precision, use 'n' to specify digits after decimal point. For example: print x \"r24z,e$(*12)\" formats x as right-aligned with scaling, commas for thousands, and fills with asterisks in a 12-character field."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I use fill characters in numeric formatting masks?", "input": "Fill character parameters: f is fill character with these options:\n%n fills with n zeros\n#n fills with n spaces\n*n fills with n asterisks\nAny other character can be included in the fill mask and output exactly as they appear. If a dollar sign is placed outside the format mask, it outputs just prior to the value. If used within the format mask, it outputs in the furthest left position.", "output": "Fill characters control how empty spaces in the formatted field are populated. Use %n for zeros, #n for spaces, and *n for asterisks, where n specifies the length up to 32,767 characters. Other characters appear exactly as written in the mask. Dollar signs behave differently: outside the mask they appear just before the value, inside the mask they appear at the leftmost position."}
{"instruction": "Can you show me a practical example of using masking with currency formatting?", "input": "Example: z = 78657767, print z \"r24z,e$(*12)\" outputs ,657,767.00\nThis masks the value of z based on current precision. The scaling factor minus precision determines actual scaling. The mask adds two zeros after decimal point and justifies the result in asterisk field. Because mask isn't specified with sufficient asterisks, only the 12 rightmost characters display.", "output": "Here's the example: when z = 78657767 and you use print z \"r24z,e$(*12)\", it outputs ',657,767.00'. The mask applies right alignment (r), 2-digit scaling (2), zero suppression (z), comma insertion (,), currency sign ($), and asterisk fill (*12). Since the result is longer than 12 characters, only the rightmost 12 characters are displayed."}
{"instruction": "How would I create a left-aligned text field with specific spacing?", "input": "Example: x = test, print x \"l(#12)\" outputs 'testbbbbbbbb' (spaces shown as 'b')\nThis value in x is left-aligned in a field of 12 characters.", "output": "Use the 'l' alignment specifier with #n for space filling. The syntax print x \"l(#12)\" creates a left-aligned field of 12 characters filled with spaces. If x contains 'test', the output will be 'test' followed by 8 spaces to fill the 12-character field."}
{"instruction": "When should I use named common variables instead of regular variables?", "input": "Named common syntax: common /ID/ variable|array{,variable|array...}\nA named common is a global, common, BASIC variable space used to store variables and arrays in the area identified by ID. Named common space is initialized only at logon and released at logoff. Named common space is common for all levels of the same process. Variables and/or arrays can be used for communication between programs and subroutines providing interprogram communication.", "output": "Use named common variables when you need to share data between different programs and subroutines within the same process. They're initialized at logon and persist until logoff, making them ideal for storing global state that multiple programs need to access. The syntax is common /ID/ variable1,variable2,array1 where ID identifies the common area."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between named common and regular variables in terms of scope?", "input": "Named common space is common for all levels of the same process (that is, level pushes, executes, file-time bridges and indexes, and so on). Variables and/or arrays can be used for communication between programs and subroutines providing interprogram communication.", "output": "Named common variables have global scope across all levels of the same process, including level pushes, executes, file-time bridges and indexes. Regular variables are local to their program or subroutine. Named common enables interprogram communication by allowing multiple programs to access the same variable space, while regular variables are isolated to their specific context."}
{"instruction": "How do relational operators handle mixed data types in BASIC?", "input": "Relational operators (=, #, >=, <=, >, <) are used to compare both strings and/or numerics. These operators first attempt to convert both operands into numerics. If successful, a numeric comparison is performed at the current precision. If unable to convert both operands into numerics, the operators convert both operands to strings and perform a left-to-right comparison. The value returned is nonzero (true) or 0 (false).", "output": "Relational operators use a two-step process: first they try to convert both operands to numbers for numeric comparison at current precision. If either operand can't be converted to a number, both are converted to strings and compared left-to-right alphabetically. The result is nonzero for true conditions or 0 for false."}
{"instruction": "Why does comparing a number to a string sometimes give unexpected results?", "input": "Example: print 2 < \"dog\" results in nonzero because 2 was converted into a string that comes before the string \"dog\" in alphabetical order.", "output": "When comparing mixed types, if either operand cannot be converted to a number, both are treated as strings. In the example 2 < \"dog\", since \"dog\" can't be converted to a number, both 2 and \"dog\" become strings. The string \"2\" comes before \"dog\" alphabetically, so the comparison returns true (nonzero)."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to compare numeric strings with actual numbers using relational operators?", "input": "Example: x = \"623abc\", print 623 = x[1,3] results in nonzero (true). Although the first 3 characters of x are actually a string of characters, the = operator was able to successfully convert this into a number and do a numeric test for equality.", "output": "Yes, relational operators can compare numeric strings with numbers. In the example where x = \"623abc\" and you compare 623 = x[1,3], the substring \"623\" can be converted to the number 623, so a numeric comparison is performed. Since both values equal 623, the result is true (nonzero)."}
{"instruction": "What's the proper way to structure multi-line conditional statements in BASIC?", "input": "Statement blocks syntax: [am|;] statement{[am|;] statement...} end\nA statement block is one or more statements that follow a BASIC decision-path related token such as then, else, locked, and onerr. am represents an attribute mark and is interchangeable with the ; (semicolon).", "output": "Multi-line statement blocks start with a decision token (then, else, locked, onerr) and end with 'end'. Statements within the block are separated by semicolons (;) or attribute marks (am). For example: 'readt tape.rec then; crt \"grabbed record\"; end'. The single-line form doesn't require 'end'."}
{"instruction": "How do I write single-line versus multi-line statement blocks?", "input": "Examples:\nreadt tape.rec then\ncrt \"grabbed record\"\nend\n\nThis is the same as:\nreadt tape.rec then ; crt \"grabbed record\"\n\nIn the single-line form, end is not allowed.\nreadt tape.rec onerr crt \"error code: \" : system(0) ; stop", "output": "Single-line blocks use semicolons to separate statements and don't use 'end': 'readt tape.rec then ; crt \"grabbed record\"'. Multi-line blocks can span multiple physical lines and must end with 'end': 'readt tape.rec then', 'crt \"grabbed record\"', 'end'. Both forms are functionally equivalent."}
{"instruction": "What are the rules for creating statement labels in BASIC?", "input": "Statement labels are used as destinations for goto or gosub statements. A statement label consists of numeric or alphanumeric string at the beginning of any BASIC statement. Numeric labels can be: 10, 1, 100.5, 01, 001, 10.02 (each is unique). Alphanumeric labels must begin with alpha character, can contain letters/numbers, and must be followed by a colon. A statement label can stand by itself on a line.", "output": "Statement labels serve as targets for goto/gosub and can be numeric (like 10, 100.5, 01) or alphanumeric. Numeric labels are written as-is and each format is unique (10 ≠ 01). Alphanumeric labels must start with a letter, can contain letters and numbers, and require a colon (like 'mainline:'). Labels can appear alone on a line or before statements."}
{"instruction": "Can you explain the difference between numeric and alphanumeric statement labels?", "input": "Numeric statement labels can be: 10, 1, 100.5, 01, 001, 10.02 - each is unique. Alphanumeric statement labels must begin with an alpha character, can be alphabetical or numeric after that, must be followed by a colon, and if a statement is on the same line it must be separated by one or more spaces.", "output": "Numeric labels are written without colons and each format is distinct (10, 01, and 001 are three different labels). Alphanumeric labels start with a letter, can contain letters and numbers, require a colon, and need space separation if followed by a statement on the same line. Example: '1000' (numeric) vs 'mainline:' (alphanumeric)."}
{"instruction": "How do I extract or modify parts of a string using substring expressions?", "input": "Substring expressions extract or assign substrings using [ and ] characters. Syntax: variable[beg.pos.exp, len.exp] = exp or variable[len.exp] = exp\nbeg.pos.exp indicates starting position. If 0, expression is inserted at beginning. If greater than string length, spaces are appended. If less than 0, spaces are inserted between expression and string.\nlen.exp is number of characters to overlay. If 0, expression is inserted prior to starting position.", "output": "Use square brackets with starting position and length: variable[start, length] = value. Position 0 inserts at beginning, positions beyond string length append spaces, negative positions insert spaces before the string. Length 0 inserts without replacing, positive length overlays that many characters. Example: string[2,2] = 'xxx' replaces 2 characters starting at position 2."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I assign a substring longer than the specified length?", "input": "Example: string = 'abcd', string[2,2] = 'xxx' results in 'axxxd'. Notice that the additional characters beyond the length of the overlay are inserted.\nIf the length of the substr.exp to overlay is greater than the len.exp, the additional characters are included in the resulting expression. Only the number of characters specified in len.exp are overlaid. The additional characters are inserted prior to the next position in the original expression.", "output": "When the replacement string is longer than the specified length, the extra characters are inserted rather than truncated. In the example, string[2,2] = 'xxx' on 'abcd' results in 'axxxd'. The first 2 characters ('xx') overlay the original 2 characters ('bc'), and the extra 'x' is inserted before the remaining characters."}
{"instruction": "Can you show me how different substring position and length combinations work?", "input": "Example program testing substring combinations:\nstring = \"abcdef\"\ns = string ; s[ 0 , 0]= \"xx\"; crt s    // xxabcdef\ns = string ; s[ 0 , 1]= \"xx\"; crt s    // xxbcdef\ns = string ; s[ 1 , 1]= \"xx\"; crt s    // xxbcdef\ns = string ; s[-1 , 0]= \"xx\"; crt s    // xx abcdef\ns = string ; s[ 7 , 0]= \"xx\"; crt s    // abcdefxx", "output": "Here are the key patterns: [0,0] inserts at beginning without replacing; [0,1] inserts at beginning and replaces 1 character; [1,1] replaces 1 character at position 1; [-1,0] inserts with a space before the string; [7,0] appends at end when position exceeds string length. The position and length parameters control both where the insertion occurs and how many original characters are replaced."}
{"instruction": "How do I properly structure then/else clauses in conditional statements?", "input": "then/else statement blocks are found with conditional statements. The if statement requires either a then or an else clause. Possible syntactic structures include single-line and multi-line forms. Single-line: then statement;statement;...; or then statement;...;else. Multi-line: then ;statement; end or then ;statement; end else ;statement; end", "output": "then/else clauses can be single-line (separated by semicolons) or multi-line (terminated with 'end'). Single-line: 'if condition then statement1;statement2; else statement3'. Multi-line: 'if condition then', 'statement1', 'statement2', 'end else', 'statement3', 'end'. The then clause is required, else is optional."}
{"instruction": "When would I use NULL statements in conditional blocks?", "input": "NULL statements are often included in then or else clauses as placeholders. A NULL statement performs no action. However, you can use NULL statements to make the logic of a conditional more clear and easier to read. Example: IF NUM(PRICE) THEN NULL END ELSE PRINT \"ERROR: NON-NUMERIC PRICE. STOP\"; STOP END", "output": "Use NULL statements as placeholders to make conditional logic clearer when no action is needed for one branch. In the example, if PRICE is numeric, no action is taken (NULL), but if it's non-numeric, an error is printed. This makes it explicit that the 'true' condition is intentionally empty rather than accidentally omitted."}
{"instruction": "What should I do when a record is locked and I don't want to wait?", "input": "The locked clause is used when the requested item is locked and waiting is not desired. Syntax: locked statement.block\nExample: readu cust.item from fv.cust,ID locked print ID:\" is locked by port \":system(0)", "output": "Use the locked clause with file operations like readu to handle locked records without waiting. The syntax is: readu record from file,key locked <statements>. In the example, if the customer item is locked, it prints which port has the lock using system(0) instead of waiting for the lock to be released."}
{"instruction": "How do I handle errors during file operations without using standard error handling?", "input": "The onerr clause identifies statements to execute when an error occurs during operations on peripheral storage devices. system(0) contains the error message associated with the onerr condition. Either an onerr clause or an else clause is allowed in a statement, but not both. When onerr exists, all media handling must be handled by the program.", "output": "Use the onerr clause to implement custom error handling for file operations. The syntax is: operation onerr <statements>. The system(0) function contains the specific error code. Unlike else clauses, onerr requires your program to handle all aspects of the error condition, including media handling like end-of-reel conditions."}
{"instruction": "Can you show me how to handle different types of file errors using onerr?", "input": "Example illustrating error processing division:\nreadt tape.rec onerr\n   condition = system(0)\n   begin case\n   case condition = 1\n      print \"tape is NOT attached...\"\n   case condition = 5\n      print \"process end of reel\"\n   case condition = 6\n      print \"tape is write-protected\"\n   end case\nend", "output": "Use system(0) to get the specific error code, then use a case statement to handle different error types. In this example: condition 1 means tape not attached, condition 5 is end of reel, condition 6 is write-protected. This allows you to provide specific responses for different error scenarios rather than generic error handling."}
{"instruction": "How do I control cursor positioning and screen clearing in terminal applications?", "input": "@() function provides standard means of performing control functions on terminals. @(num.exp{,num.exp}) syntax. Negative values generate special cursor-control characters for current terminal type. @(-1) clears screen and homes cursor, @(col,row) positions cursor at specific location. Using @() functions invalidates system(4), system(5), and system(6) function results.", "output": "Use @() with negative numbers for control functions and positive numbers for positioning. @(-1) clears screen and homes cursor, @(-2) clears to end of screen, @(column,row) positions cursor at specific coordinates.

Some terminals embed these attributes in the display (taking up space) while others keep them hidden. Use @(-1) to check if attributes are embedded (1) or hidden (0)."}
{"instruction": "How do I get the absolute value of a number in BASIC?", "input": "abs() function returns the absolute (positive) portion of the integer number derived from the given numeric expression. Syntax: abs(num.exp). If the expression is nonnumeric, 0 is assumed. Example: x = -1, y = abs(x), print y outputs 1.", "output": "Use the abs() function with the syntax abs(number). It returns the positive version of any integer number. If you pass a non-numeric value, it assumes 0. Example: abs(-1) returns 1, abs(5) returns 5, abs(-3.7) returns 3 (integer portion)."}
{"instruction": "When would I use the access() function and what information can it provide?", "input": "access() function provides data about AQL or Update processor environments when program is called from a dictionary. Complete set of num.exp can only be used in subroutines called from dictionary items. Limited functionality provided for callc, calld, calle, callo, callr, and callx triggers. Returns information like file variables, item counters, item-IDs, cursor positions, etc.", "output": "Use access() in subroutines called from dictionary items during AQL queries or Update processor operations. It provides context information: access(1) gets data file variable, access(3) gets current item, access(10) gets item-ID, access(11) gets file names, access(14)/access(15) get cursor position. This allows your subroutine to interact with the calling environment."}
{"instruction": "How can I modify data during AQL processing using the access() function?", "input": "access(3) and access(10) can pass data both ways. When on right of = operator, data is passed to program. When on left of = operator, data is passed from program to file. access(3) can be updated only from input-conversion of dictionary item. Item-IDs and attribute values can be modified directly through Update processor using input-conversion or correlative attributes.", "output": "Use access(3) and access(10) for bidirectional data exchange. Reading them gets data from the environment, assigning to them passes data back. For example: item = access(3) reads the current item, while access(3) = modified_item updates it. Note that access(3) can only be updated from input-conversion attributes, not from correlatives or other contexts."}
{"instruction": "How do I test if a string contains only alphabetic characters?", "input": "alpha() function evaluates the expression and returns 1 (true) if every character in the string is alphabetical (a-z upper and lowercase), or 0 (false) if any character is nonalphabetical. The empty (null) string (\"\") is considered nonalphabetical. Syntax: alpha(exp). Example: if alpha(response) then array(1) = response", "output": "Use the alpha(exp) function to test for alphabetic-only content. It returns 1 if all characters are letters (a-z, A-Z), or 0 if any character is non-alphabetic. Empty strings return 0 (false). Example: alpha(\"Hello\") returns 1, alpha(\"Hello123\") returns 0, alpha(\"\") returns 0."}
{"instruction": "How do I check if a variable has been assigned a value?", "input": "assigned() function determines if the variable has been assigned a value. If var has an assigned value, nonzero (true) is returned. If no value is assigned, 0 (false) is returned. Works well in BASIC subroutines called from call AQL processing code to prevent files from being repeatedly opened and variables from being re-initialized.", "output": "Use assigned(variable) to check if a variable has been given a value. It returns nonzero (true) for assigned variables, 0 (false) for unassigned ones. This is particularly useful in subroutines to avoid redundant file opens or variable initialization. Example: if not(assigned(fv.entity)) then file entity opens the file only if not already opened."}
{"instruction": "How do I replace specific occurrences of text within a string?", "input": "change() function searches str.exp for search.str. If search.str is found at the start occurrence, then replacement.str replaces search.str for the amount specified in occurrences. Syntax: change(str.exp, search.str, replacement.str{,occurrences{,start}}). occurrences specifies number to replace (default 0 = all). start specifies which occurrence to begin replacement (default 1).", "output": "Use change(string, search, replacement, count, start) to replace text. The function finds 'search' in 'string' and replaces it with 'replacement'. Optional 'count' specifies how many to replace (0 = all), 'start' specifies which occurrence to begin at.

{"instruction": "Can you show me how to replace only some occurrences starting from a specific position?", "input": "Example: print change(\"---\",\"-\",\"+\",2,1) outputs \"++-\". The change() function replaces two occurrences of \"-\" starting at the first occurrence.", "output": "The change() function with count and start parameters allows selective replacement. In change(\"---\",\"-\",\"+\",2,1), it finds \"-\" in \"---\", starts at the 1st occurrence, and replaces 2 occurrences with \"+\", resulting in \"++-\".

In assignment statements, it assigns a value to a variable (e.g., customer.item<1> = name). In conditional expressions, it acts as a relational operator to test equality (e.g., if answer = \"quit\" then stop). The context determines which function it performs - assignment when used in statements, comparison when used in logical expressions."}
{"instruction": "Show me a practical example of using the = operator for both assignment and comparison", "input": "Examples:\nThis use of the = sign illustrates assignment. The array element on the left side of the = sign is assigned the current value of the variable, name.\ncustomer.item<1> = name\n\nThis example illustrates a conditional expression.

{"instruction": "What makes the 'match' operator different from simple string comparison?", "input": "Description: The match relational operator tests a string and determines if it matches a predefined pattern of alphabetical, numeric, wildcard, or literal characters. The match operator compares a string value to a predefined pattern and evaluates to 1 (true) or 0 (false).", "output": "The 'match' operator performs pattern matching rather than exact string comparison. Instead of checking if two strings are identical, it tests whether a string conforms to a specified pattern using wildcards, character types (alphabetic, numeric), and literals. It returns 1 for true matches and 0 for false, enabling flexible string validation."}

{"instruction": "How does 'match' handle zero-length patterns?", "input": "Parameter: The m parameter, which specifies the length of the match operator string, if 0 (zero) will match 0 or more of the specified match operator. This means that the null string will match any 0 length pattern match.", "output": "When the length parameter is 0, the match operator will accept zero or more occurrences of the specified pattern. This means a null (empty) string will successfully match any 0-length pattern. For example, \"0n\" will match any string containing zero or more numeric characters, including an empty string."}

Only when 'ans' exactly equals \"y\" does it print \"Yes\". This creates a simple yes/no validation with clear feedback."}
{"instruction": "How does the 'or' operator differ from 'and' in logical expressions?", "input": "Syntax: exp or exp\nDescription: The or logical operator indicates that only one of the components of a logical expression need be true for the expression to evaluate as true.", "output": "The 'or' operator requires only one component to be true for the entire expression to evaluate as true, while 'and' requires all components to be true. With 'or', the expression is false only when all components are false. This implements inclusive OR logic where any satisfied condition makes the whole expression true."}
{"instruction": "Show me how multiple 'or' conditions work in practice", "input": "Example: The expression counter > max or value > 10 or y < 100 requires that only one or more logical expressions need be true for the complete expression to be true.\nif counter > max or value > 10 or y < 100 then...", "output": "Here's a multiple 'or' example:\nif counter > max or value > 10 or y < 100 then...\n\nThis expression is true if ANY of these conditions are met:\n- counter is greater than max, OR\n- value is greater than 10, OR  \n- y is less than 100\n\nThe then clause executes if one, two, or all three conditions are true. It's false only when all three conditions fail."}
{"instruction": "What's the performance benefit of single attribute specification with 'or'?", "input": "Example: You can use the single attribute specification form of the or logical operator to optimize your queries.

The semicolons separate the loop initialization, body, and termination statements."}
{"instruction": "What are the different uses of the comma operator in FlashBASIC?", "input": "Description: The comma reserved character has several purposes: Separates subscript references within multidimensional arrays; Separates ac.exp, vc.exp, and sc.exp in dynamic array references; Delimits arguments within functions; Separates passed arguments in a call statement; When used with the crt or print statement, tabs to the next tab stop; Line continuation for subroutine, call, common, dimension, equate and data statements.", "output": "The comma serves multiple purposes in FlashBASIC:\n1. Separates subscripts in multidimensional arrays\n2. Separates attribute, value, and subvalue expressions in dynamic arrays\n3. Delimits function arguments\n4. Separates arguments in call statements\n5. Creates tab stops (every 18 columns) in print/crt statements\n6.

The break statement accepts any numeric expression - when it evaluates to 0 (false), the BREAK key is disabled; when nonzero (true), it's enabled.\n\nFor example: break user = \"fred\"\nThis enables the BREAK key only if the user variable equals \"fred\", allowing you to provide break functionality based on user privileges or other conditions."}
{"instruction": "What happens if multiple break off statements are executed?", "input": "The break statement enables or disables the BREAK key.\nParameters: off - Disables the BREAK key. on - Reverses the effect of the last executed break off statement. If multiple break off statements are executed, an equal number of break on statements must be executed to return to a breakable state.", "output": "When multiple break off statements are executed, they create a stack-like effect. You must execute an equal number of break on statements to fully re-enable the BREAK key functionality. Each break on only reverses one break off, so if you've executed three break off statements, you'll need three break on statements to return to a breakable state."}
{"instruction": "How do I call an external subroutine and pass arguments to it?", "input": "The call statement transfers control to an external FlashBASIC or BASIC subroutine and optionally passes a list of arguments to it. Arguments must be separated with a comma. When passing arguments, the same number must occur in the call statement as are declared in the subroutine statement.\nSyntax: call cataloged.program.name{(arg{,arg...})}\ncall @ program.name.var{(arg{,arg...})}\ncall \"file.ref program.name\"{(arg{,arg...})}\nExample: call process.lines(ID,order.item(1))", "output": "Use the call statement to invoke external subroutines with arguments:\n\nDirect call: call process.lines(ID,order.item(1))\nIndirect call: call @program.var(ID,order.item(1))\nWith file path: call \"dm,bp, process.lines\"(ID,order.item(1))\n\nArguments are separated by commas, and the number of arguments in the call must match those declared in the subroutine statement. The subroutine can modify variable arguments and return values to the calling program."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between direct and indirect calls in FlashBASIC?", "input": "The call @ or indirect call form allows the statement to use the subroutine name assigned to a specific variable.\nSyntax: call cataloged.program.name{(arg{,arg...})}\ncall @ program.name.var{(arg{,arg...})}\nExamples: Direct call: call process.lines(ID,order.item(1))\nIndirect call: program.var = \"process.lines\"\ncall @program.var(ID,order.item(1))", "output": "The difference lies in how the subroutine name is specified:\n\nDirect call: The subroutine name is explicitly stated in the code\ncall process.lines(ID,order.item(1))\n\nIndirect call: The subroutine name is stored in a variable and referenced with @\nprogram.var = \"process.lines\"\ncall @program.var(ID,order.item(1))\n\nIndirect calls provide flexibility by allowing the subroutine name to be determined at runtime, enabling dynamic program behavior."}
{"instruction": "When would I need to specify a file path in a call statement?", "input": "It is possible to specify the file path name followed by a space followed by the actual subroutine name. The file path and program name can be passed via a variable to an indirect call, or the string can be enclosed in quotation marks and embedded directly into the program text. Specifying a direct file reference and program name eliminates the need for cataloging subroutines when an application is used from other accounts.\nExample: program.var = \"dm,bp, process.lines\"\ncall @program.var(ID,order.item(1))", "output": "Specify a file path in call statements when you want to access subroutines from specific file locations without cataloging them. This is particularly useful when:\n\n1. Running applications from different accounts\n2. Avoiding the need to catalog subroutines\n3. Directly referencing subroutines in specific dictionaries\n\nExample: program.var = \"dm,bp, process.lines\"\ncall @program.var(ID,order.item(1))\n\nThis calls the process.lines subroutine directly from the dm,bp dictionary without requiring it to be cataloged."}
{"instruction": "How do I resume data capturing that was previously turned off?", "input": "The capturing statement resumes the capturing effect from the previous execute...capturing statements in a FlashBASIC or BASIC program.\nSyntax: capturing [off|on|var]\nParameters: off - Turns off the capturing effect. on - Resumes the capturing effect. var - Capturing is turned on if the variable evaluates to non-zero (true) and turned off if it evaluates to 0 (false).", "output": "Use the capturing statement to resume data capturing:\n\ncapturing on - Resumes the capturing effect from previous execute...capturing statements\ncapturing off - Turns off capturing\ncapturing variable - Conditionally enables/disables based on variable value\n\nThis allows you to control whether output from executed commands is captured into variables for further processing."}

The capturing statement accepts a variable that determines the capturing state based on its value:\n\nread capstat from statfile,'capstat' else capstat = 0\ncapturing capstat\n\nIf capstat is non-zero (true), capturing is enabled. If capstat is 0 (false), capturing is disabled. This allows dynamic control over capturing behavior based on configuration settings or program state."}
{"instruction": "How do I create a multi-way conditional branch in FlashBASIC?", "input": "The case statement delineates a conditional case construct. Only the statements following the first true case statement are executed. Upon completion of these statements, program execution continues immediately following the end case statement.\nSyntax: begin case\n   case logical.exp \n   {statement{s}}\nend case\nExample: begin case\ncase response = \"p\"\n   printer on\ncase response = \"s\"\n   echo off\ncase 1\n   crt \"response must be 'p' or 's'\"\nend case", "output": "Use the case statement to create multi-way conditional branches:\n\nbegin case\ncase response = \"p\"\n   printer on\ncase response = \"s\"\n   echo off\ncase 1\n   crt \"response must be 'p' or 's'\"\nend case\n\nOnly the first true case condition executes its statements, then control jumps to after end case. Use 'case 1' as a default clause that always executes if no previous cases were true."}
{"instruction": "What's the purpose of 'case 1' in a case statement?", "input": "The case statement delineates a conditional case construct. If all case statements evaluate false, program execution is continued at the first statement after the end case. A case 1 statement always evaluates true and is used as the last case statement to be processed only when all previous case statements evaluate to false.\nExample: case 1\n   crt \"response must be 'p' or 's'\"", "output": "'case 1' serves as a default or catch-all clause in case statements. Since 1 always evaluates to true, this case will execute only if all previous case conditions were false. It's equivalent to an 'else' clause in other programming constructs.\n\nIn the example, if response is neither 'p' nor 's', the case 1 clause executes and displays the error message. This ensures that some action is always taken even when no specific conditions are met."}
{"instruction": "When should I use case statements versus nested if statements?", "input": "The case statement delineates a conditional case construct. Only the statements following the first true case statement are executed. The case statement is equivalent to nested if expressions as follows: The statements between case statements are executed if the expression associated with the case statement evaluates to true.", "output": "Use case statements when you have multiple mutually exclusive conditions to test, as they provide cleaner, more readable code than nested if statements. Case statements are particularly useful when:\n\n1. Testing a single variable against multiple values\n2. You need only the first true condition to execute\n3. You want more structured, maintainable code\n\nCase statements automatically handle the branching logic and continue execution after the end case, making them more efficient and easier to follow than complex nested if-then-else structures."}
{"instruction": "How do I make string comparisons case-sensitive in my program?", "input": "The casing statement toggles case sensitivity relative to input data and string comparisons in the current program and any called subroutines. With casing on, the strings \"quit\", \"Quit\", and \"QUIT\" are treated as three different strings of characters. With casing off they are all treated as the same string.\nSyntax: casing [on|off|exp]\nParameters: on - Enables case sensitivity. off - Disables case sensitivity.", "output": "Use the casing statement to control case sensitivity:\n\ncasing on - Enables case sensitivity, making \"quit\", \"Quit\", and \"QUIT\" distinct strings\ncasing off - Disables case sensitivity, treating those strings as identical\ncasing expression - Conditionally enables/disables based on expression value\n\nThe casing setting affects both input data processing and string comparisons throughout your program and any subroutines it calls."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I enable case sensitivity in FlashBASIC?", "input": "The casing statement toggles case sensitivity relative to input data and string comparisons in the current program and any called subroutines. With casing on, the strings \"quit\", \"Quit\", and \"QUIT\" are treated as three different strings of characters. With casing off they are all treated as the same string.\nExample: casing on\ncrt \"enter quit \" :\ninput quit\nif quit = \"quit\" then crt \"lower case\" end else crt \"upper case\"", "output": "When case sensitivity is enabled with 'casing on', string comparisons become exact character matches including case. In the example:\n\ncasing on\nif quit = \"quit\" then crt \"lower case\" end else crt \"upper case\"\n\nEntering \"quit\" displays \"lower case\", but entering \"Quit\" or \"QUIT\" displays \"upper case\" because the uppercase characters make them different strings. This allows for precise string matching when case distinctions are important."}
{"instruction": "How do I access C libraries from my BASIC program?", "input": "The cfunction statement provides access to C libraries from BASIC.\nSyntax: cfunction name{,name...}\nExamples: cfunction unix.builtin\ncfunction user.builtin, gm.builtin", "output": "Use the cfunction statement to access C libraries from BASIC:\n\ncfunction unix.builtin\ncfunction user.builtin, gm.builtin\n\nYou can specify single or multiple C function libraries separated by commas. This statement makes the specified C library functions available for use within your BASIC program, allowing you to extend functionality beyond standard BASIC capabilities."}
{"instruction": "What happens after a chain statement executes?", "input": "The chain statement transfers processing control to TCL, which interprets and executes the statement defined in the expression. When the TCL expression finishes, control does not return to the program. The chain statement transfers control one way only.\nSyntax: chain tcl.exp\nExamples: chain \"file-save\"\nchain \"off\"", "output": "After a chain statement executes, control does NOT return to your program. The chain statement provides one-way transfer of control to TCL. Once the specified TCL command completes execution, the program terminates rather than continuing from the next statement.\n\nFor example:\nchain \"file-save\" - executes the file-save command and then ends\nchain \"off\" - logs off the user session\n\nUse chain when you want to end your program and execute a TCL command, not when you need to return control to your program."}
{"instruction": "How is chain different from execute in FlashBASIC?", "input": "The chain statement transfers processing control to TCL, which interprets and executes the statement defined in the expression. When the TCL expression finishes, control does not return to the program. The chain statement transfers control one way only.", "output": "The key difference between chain and execute is control flow:\n\nchain: One-way transfer - control passes to TCL and never returns to your program\nexecute: Two-way transfer - control passes to TCL, executes the command, then returns to continue your program\n\nUse chain when you want to end your program and run a TCL command (like logging off or starting another program). Use execute when you want to run a TCL command and then continue with your program logic."}
{"instruction": "When would I need to clear the data stack?", "input": "The cleardata statement clears the data stack.\nExample: The following program is invoked from a macro. A list of filenames and record IDs is passed to it from the macro with DATA statements.\n5 *\ninput filename\nif filename = \"end\" then stop\nopen filename to file else\n   print \"can't open file \":filename\n   print \"please enter new filename \"\n   cleardata\n   goto 5\nend", "output": "Use cleardata when you need to clear the data stack, typically in error recovery situations. In the example, when a file cannot be opened, cleardata removes any remaining data from the stack before prompting for a new filename.\n\nThis prevents old data values from interfering with new input and ensures a clean state for error recovery. It's particularly useful when:\n1. Handling errors in programs called from macros with DATA statements\n2. Recovering from input validation failures\n3. Resetting program state after exceptions"}
{"instruction": "How do I clear an active select list and free its memory?", "input": "The clearselect statement clears the active select-list specified by the list.var and releases all overflow associated with that list. Any external select-list is also cleared if the list variable is not specified.\nSyntax: clearselect {list.var}\nExample 1: if hours > 40 then\n    clearselect\n    goto 5\nend", "output": "Use the clearselect statement to clear select lists and free memory:\n\nclearselect - Clears the external select-list\nclearselect list.var - Clears the specific select-list variable\n\nThis releases all memory and overflow storage associated with the list. In the example, when hours exceed 40, clearselect terminates the select loop and frees the associated resources. This is important for memory management in programs that process large select lists."}
{"instruction": "Can I use clearselect to free up variable memory?", "input": "The clearselect statement clears the active select-list specified by the list.var and releases all overflow associated with that list.\nExample 2: This example shows how to un-assign a variable to clear memory so that the memory can be used for something else:\na = 5\nprint a \nclearselect a\nprint a\nOutput: 5\n[B10] in program \"p21\", Line 4:\nVariable has not been assigned a value; zero used.\n0", "output": "Yes, clearselect can un-assign variables to free memory. When you use clearselect on a regular variable, it removes the variable's assignment, making that memory available for reuse.\n\nExample:\na = 5\nprint a          * prints: 5\nclearselect a\nprint a          * prints: 0 with warning message\n\nAfter clearselect, the variable becomes unassigned and will generate a warning if accessed, defaulting to zero. This technique is useful for freeing memory from large variables when they're no longer needed."}
{"instruction": "How do I properly close a file in FlashBASIC?", "input": "The close statement closes the file identified by file.var. If file.var is not specified, the file referenced by the default file.var is closed. Files close by default when a program ends. A file should be closed before it is deleted.\nSyntax: close {file.var}\nExample: open 'testfile' to testfile then\nclose testfile\nexecute 'delete-file testfile'\nend", "output": "Use the close statement to properly close files:\n\nclose file.var - Closes the specified file\nclose - Closes the default file variable\n\nExample:\nopen 'testfile' to testfile then\nclose testfile\nexecute 'delete-file testfile'\nend\n\nAlways close files before deleting them. While files close automatically when programs end, explicit closing is important when you need to delete files or manage resources carefully, especially when set-remote-close is enabled."}
{"instruction": "What happens when set-remote-close is enabled and I close a file?", "input": "The close statement closes the file identified by file.var. If used when the TCL set-remote-close command is set to on, the close statement also closes any associated remote files and releases any resources allocated to open files (such as memory and handles). If set-remote-close is set to on, item locks and file locks associated with that file handle are released.", "output": "When set-remote-close is enabled, the close statement performs additional cleanup:\n\n1. Closes any associated remote files\n2. Releases all allocated resources (memory and handles)\n3. Releases item locks and file locks associated with that file handle\n\nThis provides comprehensive resource cleanup, ensuring that both local and remote file resources are properly freed, and that any locks held on the file are released when the file is closed."}
{"instruction": "Why should I close a file before executing delete-file?", "input": "The close statement closes the file identified by file.var. This statement must be used if a file is opened and then a delete-file is executed with an execute statement. A file should be closed before it is deleted.\nExample: open 'testfile' to testfile then\nclose testfile\nexecute 'delete-file testfile'\nend", "output": "You must close a file before executing delete-file to prevent resource conflicts and ensure proper file deletion. Open file handles can prevent the delete operation from succeeding or cause system resource issues.\n\nThe correct sequence is:\n1. Open the file\n2. Perform operations\n3. Close the file\n4. Delete the file\n\nExample:\nopen 'testfile' to testfile then\nclose testfile\nexecute 'delete-file testfile'\nend\n\nThis ensures the file handle is released before attempting deletion."}
{"instruction": "How do I implement transaction processing with commit work?", "input": "The commit work operation commits a transaction. This operation reliably logs all updates made since the last begin work statement to the database in atomic fashion.\nSyntax: commit {work|transaction} {then|else statement.block}\nExample: open \"myfile\" to f1\nopen \"mylog\" to f2\nbegin work\n   readu total from f1,\"total\"\n   total = total + 1\n   write total on f1,\"total\"\n   write total on f2,timedate()\ncommit work else print \"Could not update\"", "output": "Implement transaction processing using begin work and commit work:\n\nopen \"myfile\" to f1\nopen \"mylog\" to f2\nbegin work\n   readu total from f1,\"total\"\n   total = total + 1\n   write total on f1,\"total\"\n   write total on f2,timedate()\ncommit work else print \"Could not update\"\n\nAll operations between begin work and commit work are treated as a single atomic unit. If commit succeeds, all changes are permanently saved. If it fails, the else clause executes and all changes are rolled back."}
{"instruction": "What happens if a commit work operation fails?", "input": "The commit work operation commits a transaction. If the commit process fails under normal operations, then the entire transaction is undone and the else statement.block is taken, if present. Note that in this case, it is necessary to completely redo all updates performed by the transaction (after correcting the problem that led to the failure).", "output": "If commit work fails:\n\n1. The entire transaction is automatically rolled back (undone)\n2. The else statement block executes, if present\n3. All updates made since begin work are lost\n4. You must completely redo all transaction operations after fixing the problem\n\nThis ensures database consistency - either all changes in the transaction succeed together, or none of them are applied. The atomic nature prevents partial updates that could corrupt data integrity."}
{"instruction": "How do I share variables between different BASIC programs?", "input": "The common statement declares data elements to share among different FlashBASIC or BASIC modules. The common statement can be used to share variables between programs and other programs or subroutines.\nSyntax: common {/ID/} var{,var...} {,array(dimension1{,dimension2})...}\nExample: common x,y,z(10)", "output": "Use the common statement to share variables between programs:\n\ncommon x,y,z(10)\n\nThis creates shared storage for variables x, y, and array z(10) that can be accessed by multiple programs. All programs that declare the same common variables in the same order will share the same memory locations. This allows data to persist and be shared across different program modules during execution."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between regular common and named common areas?", "input": "The common statement declares data elements to share among different FlashBASIC or BASIC modules. The ID option is used to specify a unique common area called a named common area. Multiple unique named common areas can be declared within the same program module. Named common space is preserved during an entire logon session.\nSyntax: common {/ID/} var{,var...}\nExample: common /mydata/ name,zip", "output": "Named common areas provide more control than regular common:\n\nRegular common: common x,y,z\n- Shared based on declaration order\n- Variables must appear in same sequence across programs\n\nNamed common: common /mydata/ name,zip\n- Identified by unique ID (/mydata/)\n- Multiple named areas can exist in same program\n- Preserved for entire logon session\n- Shared by ID rather than position\n\nNamed common is more flexible and reliable for complex applications with multiple shared data areas."}
{"instruction": "Why is variable order important in common statements?", "input": "The common statement declares data elements to share among different FlashBASIC or BASIC modules. common variables (including dimensioned arrays) are allocated in the order they are declared. The order of variables in common statements is critical. The names of the variables are ignored but the order of appearance determines the association.", "output": "Variable order in common statements is critical because:\n\n1. Variables are allocated in declaration order\n2. Variable names are ignored - only position matters\n3. The order determines which variables are associated between programs\n\nFor example:\nProgram A: common x,y,z\nProgram B: common a,b,c\n\nVariable x shares memory with a, y with b, and z with c, regardless of their names. If Program B declared common c,a,b instead, then x would share with c, y with a, and z with b. Consistent ordering across all programs is essential for proper data sharing."}
{"instruction": "How do I compare two dynamic arrays to find common elements?", "input": "The compare statement compares two dynamic arrays. The compare statement scans through each element in str.exp1 to verify if that element also exists in str.exp2. At completion, var1 contains a list of elements that exist in str.exp1 and in str.exp2.

Any character designated in str.exp1 is replaced with the corresponding replacement character from str.exp2. The correspondence is by column position in str.exp1 and str.exp2.", "output": "Use the convert statement when you need to perform character-by-character replacement based on position correspondence. It's particularly useful for replacing special characters like attribute marks, converting between different character sets, or performing multiple character substitutions in a single operation. Unlike other replacement methods, convert works by positional mapping between the search and replacement strings."}
{"instruction": "How do I output text to the terminal that won't be affected by printer settings?", "input": "Syntax: crt {exp{,exp..}{:}\n\nDescription: The crt statement outputs unconditionally to the terminal display, regardless of whether or not the printer on condition is in effect.

The syntax is: crt {exp{,exp..}{:}. Unlike the print statement, crt is never redirected to a printer and always displays on the terminal screen."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between using commas and colons in crt statements?", "input": "Description: When expressions are separated by commas, the next expression is output starting at the column position defined by the next output tab. A colon at the end inhibits the output of a CR/LF following the output of the last printed line.", "output": "In crt statements, commas separate expressions and cause the next expression to start at the next tab position. A colon at the end of the statement inhibits the carriage return/line feed, so the cursor stays on the same line after output. This is useful for prompting user input on the same line."}
{"instruction": "Show me how crt can be used during printing operations to display status messages.", "input": "Example: printer on, for l = 1 to maxlines, print line<l> ;* to printer, if rem(l,50) else crt l ;* to screen, next l, printer close, printer off - The line counter l displays on the screen every 50 lines.", "output": "Here's an example of using crt for status messages during printing: printer on, for l = 1 to maxlines, print line<l> ;* to printer, if rem(l,50) else crt l ;* to screen, next l, printer close, printer off.

This deletes the value \"red\" (the 3rd value) from the dynamic array colors. The reference to attribute 1 is required since the absence of attribute marks means it's treated as a single attribute."}
{"instruction": "What happens if a delete operation fails due to network issues?", "input": "Syntax: delete {file.var}, ID.exp{on.error.clause}\n\nDescription: The delete statement removes a specific item from a file. The on.error.clause is taken if the update fails due to a lost network connection or a callx that executes an inputerr statement.", "output": "If a delete operation fails due to network issues or a callx executing an inputerr statement, the on.error.clause is executed. This clause consists of the text 'on error' followed by a statement list that handles the error condition, allowing your program to gracefully handle network failures during file updates."}

{"instruction": "When should I dimension an array without specifying the number of elements?", "input": "Description: A dimension statement without the number of elements specified (such as in the case dim a()) can only be used in a subroutine. FlashBASIC or BASIC run time determines the number of elements after a matread.", "output": "Use dimension without specifying elements (dim a()) only in subroutines where the array size will be determined at runtime after a matread operation. This allows FlashBASIC or BASIC runtime to automatically size the array based on the data being read, which is useful when you don't know the array size in advance."}
{"instruction": "What are the rules for re-dimensioning arrays in subroutines?", "input": "Description: If an array is passed to a subroutine in an argument list, it cannot be re-dimensioned within the subroutine. A passed array can only be dimensioned once within a subroutine. Local arrays can be re-dimensioned as necessary. When arrays are dimensioned both in a subroutine and within the calling program, the dimensions specified in the calling program supersede those specified within the subroutine if the subroutine's array was dimensioned as an empty dimension.", "output": "Arrays passed to subroutines in argument lists cannot be re-dimensioned within the subroutine and can only be dimensioned once. However, local arrays can be re-dimensioned as needed. If arrays are dimensioned in both the calling program and subroutine, the calling program's dimensions take precedence when the subroutine uses empty dimension syntax."}

Once the password is accepted, echo is enabled.", "output": "Here's a secure password input example: crt \"enter password \" :, echo off, input password, echo on. This prompts for a password, turns off echo so the password doesn't display as it's typed, accepts the input, then re-enables echo for normal operation."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between end as a program terminator and end for conditional statements?", "input": "Description: The end statement indicates both the end of a series of statements executed conditionally from a then or else condition or the physical end of the program. The end statement is used in two ways: Physical program end (optional) - The trailing end statement is not required on source code, but is helpful for program readability. Multiline then/else statements must have terminating end statements.", "output": "The end statement serves two purposes: as a physical program terminator (optional but recommended for readability) and as a required terminator for multiline then/else conditional statements. When used to end a program, any statements after end are not compiled. When used with conditionals, it marks the end of the statement block."}
{"instruction": "Why do I need end statements with multiline if-then-else blocks?", "input": "Example: if ans='n' then, print 'Please retype ':, goto 10, end", "output": "Multiline then/else statements require terminating end statements to mark where the conditional block ends. For example: if ans='n' then, print 'Please retype ':, goto 10, end. Without the end statement, the compiler wouldn't know where the conditional block terminates, leading to syntax errors."}
{"instruction": "How does enter differ from chain when transferring control to another program?", "input": "Description: The enter statement transfers control to another cataloged FlashBASIC or BASIC program. Control does not return to the original program. In this way, enter is similar to chain except that enter must be used to activate another FlashBASIC or BASIC program and nothing else.", "output": "The enter statement transfers control to another cataloged FlashBASIC or BASIC program without returning control to the original program, similar to chain. However, enter is specifically designed for FlashBASIC or BASIC programs only, while chain can execute other types of commands. Both result in permanent transfer of control."}
{"instruction": "What variables are preserved when using enter to transfer between programs?", "input": "Description: All variables passed between programs must be declared by the common statement in all program segments that are to be entered. All other variables are initialized upon entering the program. The common area grows or shrinks if the size is different between programs.", "output": "Only variables declared with the common statement are preserved when using enter to transfer between programs. All other variables are initialized (reset) when entering the new program. The common area automatically adjusts its size if the dimensions differ between programs."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to pass a variable between programs using enter.", "input": "Example: program first.prog, common x,y,z, x = 5, enter second.prog; program second.prog, common x,y,z, print x, stop - In this example, a 5 is output.", "output": "Here's an example of passing variables between programs: In first.prog: common x,y,z, x = 5, enter second.prog. In second.prog: common x,y,z, print x, stop. This outputs 5 because the variable x is preserved through the common statement when control transfers from first.prog to second.prog."}
{"instruction": "How do I create symbolic constants for special characters in my program?", "input": "Syntax: equate symbol to char(constant) {,var to exp...}, equate symbol to var\n\nDescription: The equate statement is a compiler directive that declares a constant at compile time or a synonym of another variable or array element. Once equate has been used to assign a value to a symbol, the variable cannot be used as a variable and cannot be reassigned a value.", "output": "Use the equate statement to create symbolic constants: equate symbol to char(constant). This is a compiler directive that creates constants at compile time. Once a symbol is equated, it cannot be used as a variable or reassigned. This is useful for creating meaningful names for special characters or constants."}
{"instruction": "Give me examples of using equate for common special characters.", "input": "Examples: equ form.feed to char(12), equ ring.bell to char(7), equ attribute.mark to char(254)", "output": "Here are examples of equating special characters: equ form.feed to char(12), equ ring.bell to char(7), equ attribute.mark to char(254). This creates meaningful symbolic names for form feed, bell character, and attribute mark characters that can be used throughout your program instead of remembering the character codes."}
{"instruction": "How do I display custom error messages in my program?", "input": "Syntax: error message.num,\"parameter\"{,\"parameter\"...}\n\nDescription: The error statement displays the error message from the messages file and continues execution of the program. The parameters are passed to the error message handler and displayed according to the requirements of the item in the messages file.", "output": "Use the error statement with the syntax: error message.num,\"parameter\"{,\"parameter\"...}. This displays an error message from the messages file using the specified message number and parameters. The program continues execution after displaying the error, unlike stop which terminates the program."}

This displays the error message \"[202] 'test' is not on file.\" when the item 'test' cannot be read from the customer file, then continues program execution."}
{"instruction": "How can I capture the output from a TCL command for later processing?", "input": "Syntax: execute tcl.exp{returning var} {capturing var}\n\nDescription: The execute statement temporarily pushes a level and performs any valid TCL expression. The results of the TCL command can be assigned to a variable for later processing by using the optional capturing clause. In the capturing clause, CR/LF combinations are converted to attribute marks.", "output": "Use the capturing clause with the execute statement: execute tcl.exp capturing var. This assigns the output of the TCL command to the specified variable for later processing. CR/LF combinations are automatically converted to attribute marks, allowing you to treat the captured output as a dynamic array."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between the returning and capturing clauses in execute?", "input": "Description: The optional returning clause directs any error message item IDs generated as a result of the execute statement into the specified variable. In the capturing clause, CR/LF combinations are converted to attribute marks, which allow the variable to be treated like a dynamic array.", "output": "The returning clause captures error message item IDs generated by the execute statement, while the capturing clause captures the actual output of the command. The capturing clause converts CR/LF to attribute marks, making the output usable as a dynamic array, whereas returning focuses on error handling."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to execute a UNIX command and capture its output.", "input": "Syntax: execute \"!unix.command\" {capturing var} {returning var}\n\nExample: execute '!exec cat ':uname capturing item - The cat UNIX command copies a file to stdout, which is captured.", "output": "Use execute \"!unix.command\" capturing var to run UNIX commands and capture output. For example: execute '!exec cat ':uname capturing item. This executes the UNIX cat command to copy a file to stdout, and the output is captured in the 'item' variable for further processing in your program."}
{"instruction": "How do I exit from a loop before it completes normally?", "input": "Syntax: exit\n\nDescription: The exit statement forces an early exit from a loop that is under for...next or loop...repeat control. The program continues with the next executable statement after the next or repeat statement.", "output": "Use the exit statement to force an early exit from for...next or loop...repeat constructs. When exit is executed, the program immediately jumps to the statement following the corresponding next or repeat statement, bypassing any remaining loop iterations."}
{"instruction": "Give me an example of using exit to break out of a loop based on user input.", "input": "Example: loop, input guess, if guess='end' then exit, while guess > 1 and guess < 100 do repeat", "output": "Here's an example using exit to break from a loop: loop, input guess, if guess='end' then exit, while guess > 1 and guess < 100 do repeat. This creates a loop that continues until the user enters 'end', at which point the exit statement breaks out of the loop regardless of the while condition."}
{"instruction": "How would I use attribute definition items from a file's dictionary while compiling my FlashBASIC program?", "input": "Syntax: file file1{,file2...}\n\nDescription: The file statement is a compiler directive that allows the use of attribute definition items in the file's dictionary while compiling a program. The file statement is typically used to allow the use of attribute definition items to identify the attribute count of the field and automatically apply dictionary correlative codes to the field value in the item. When the FlashBASIC or BASIC compiler encounters a file statement, it opens the dictionary of the file specified by file1, creates the executable code to open the data portion of the file during execution, scans the FlashBASIC or BASIC code for references to the given file, and dimensions an array with the same name as the file specified.", "output": "Use the `file` statement as a compiler directive. The syntax is `file file1{,file2...}` where file1, file2, etc. are the files from which you want to extract attribute definition items. When the compiler encounters this statement, it automatically opens the dictionary of the specified file, creates executable code to open the data portion during execution, scans your code for references to that file, and dimensions an array with the same name as the file. This allows you to reference attributes within items using attribute names from the dictionary as array subscripts, like `file1(credit.limit)`."}
{"instruction": "What happens when the compiler processes a file statement in my code?", "input": "Description: When the FlashBASIC or BASIC compiler encounters a file statement, it opens the dictionary of the file specified by file1, creates the executable code to open the data portion of the file during execution, scans the FlashBASIC or BASIC code for references to the given file, and dimensions an array with the same name as the file specified. The size of the dimensioned array is determined by the compiler. It scans the program looking for references to attribute names as dimensioned array subscripts (for example, file1(credit.limit)). After it has found all references to the given file, it takes the highest attribute count reference derived, adds 1 to it, and uses the resulting value as the size of the dimensioned array.", "output": "When the compiler processes a file statement, it performs several operations: 1) Opens the dictionary of the specified file, 2) Creates executable code to open the data portion during runtime, 3) Scans your entire program for references to the file, 4) Dimensions an array with the same name as the file. The array size is determined by finding the highest attribute count reference in your code, adding 1 to it, and using that result as the array size. For example, if your highest reference is `file1(credit.limit)` and credit.limit has attribute count 25, the array would be dimensioned to size 26."}
{"instruction": "Show me a practical example of using the file statement with attribute references.", "input": "Example: The file entity is bound by the file statement. When item \"100\" is successfully read, the name field is checked. If the name field is null, \"no name\" is output to the terminal.\n\nfile entity\nID = \"100\"\nread entity from ID then\nif entity(name) = \"\" then crt \"no name!\"\nend", "output": "Here's a practical example:\n\n```\nfile entity\nID = \"100\"\nread entity from ID then\nif entity(name) = \"\" then crt \"no name!\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, the `file entity` statement binds the entity file and allows you to use attribute names from its dictionary. After successfully reading item \"100\" into the entity array, you can reference the `name` attribute directly using `entity(name)`. If the name field is empty, the program outputs \"no name!\" to the terminal. This demonstrates how the file statement enables you to use meaningful attribute names instead of numeric positions."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to prevent reopening a file each time a subroutine is called from AQL?", "input": "Example: This determines if the file variable fv.entity has been assigned by AQL to the Update processor. If it has not been assigned, the file statement is executed. This technique is particularly useful when calling subroutines from AQL, and prevents having to reopen a file each time the routine is called. Using this logic, the file statement is executed once.\n\nfv.entity = access(1)\nif not(assigned(fv.entity)) then file entity", "output": "Yes, you can prevent reopening a file each time by checking if the file variable has already been assigned. Use this technique:\n\n```\nfv.entity = access(1)\nif not(assigned(fv.entity)) then file entity\n```\n\nThis code checks if the file variable `fv.entity` has been assigned by AQL to the Update processor using `access(1)`. If it hasn't been assigned (using the `assigned()` function), then the file statement is executed. This is particularly useful when calling subroutines from AQL because it prevents having to reopen the file each time the routine is called - the file statement executes only once."}
{"instruction": "How can I create a custom footer that appears at the bottom of each printed page?", "input": "Syntax: footing str.exp\nfooting \"{{text} {'options'}...}\"\n\nDescription: The footing statement designates a text string composed of literals and special options to output at the bottom of each page. The string expression is treated as any BASIC character string and can be surrounded by \" or \\, or the expression can be contained in a variable. Embedded footing options must be enclosed within ' to distinguish them from text. Multiple options can be enclosed in the same set of single quotation marks.", "output": "Use the `footing` statement to create a custom footer. The syntax is `footing str.exp` or `footing \"{{text} {'options'}...}\"`. The string expression can be a literal string surrounded by quotes or backslashes, or contained in a variable. For embedded footing options (like page numbers, dates, etc.), enclose them within single quotes to distinguish them from regular text. You can include multiple options within the same set of single quotation marks. The footing will appear at the bottom of each page when your program outputs paginated content."}
{"instruction": "What special options can I include in a footing statement?", "input": "Example: footing \"'lc'page 'pn' printed at 'tlc'\"\nThe above footing statement uses a literal string for the string expression and produces a footing that looks as follows:\npage '1' printed at 13:45:00 10 FEB 2003", "output": "The footing statement supports several special options that must be enclosed in single quotes: `'lc'` for line centering, `'pn'` for page number, and `'tlc'` for time/date stamp. In the example `footing \"'lc'page 'pn' printed at 'tlc'\"`, this produces a footer like \"page '1' printed at 13:45:00 10 FEB 2003\". The `'lc'` centers the line, `'pn'` inserts the current page number, and `'tlc'` inserts the current time and date."}
{"instruction": "Can I store my footing expression in a variable instead of using a literal string?", "input": "Example: The same footing expression can be placed in a variable, and the variable name used in the footing statement.\nfootstring=\"'lc'page 'pn' printed at 'tlc'\"\nfooting footstring", "output": "Yes, you can store your footing expression in a variable and reference it in the footing statement. For example:\n\n```\nfootstring=\"'lc'page 'pn' printed at 'tlc'\"\nfooting footstring\n```\n\nThis approach is useful when you want to reuse the same footing expression multiple times or when you need to build the footing dynamically. The variable contains the same format string with embedded options in single quotes, and you simply pass the variable name to the footing statement."}
{"instruction": "How would I create a compound footing expression using string concatenation?", "input": "Example: In this example, the footing expression is a compound string expression.\nfooting \"'lc'page 'pn'\":message:\"'l'\"", "output": "You can create compound footing expressions using string concatenation with the colon operator. For example:\n\n```\nfooting \"'lc'page 'pn'\":message:\"'l'\"\n```\n\nThis example concatenates three parts: `\"'lc'page 'pn'\"` (centered page number), the variable `message`, and `\"'l'\"` (line feed). The colon (`:`) operator joins these string expressions together to form a single compound footing that combines literal text, variables, and formatting options."}

A for...next loop executes a set of statements for successive values of a variable until a limiting value is encountered.", "output": "Use the `for...next` statement to create an iterative loop. The syntax is:\n\n```\nfor var = num.exp1 to num.exp2 {step num.exp3} {[while|until] logical.exp}\n  statement(s)\nnext var\n```\n\nThe loop variable `var` starts at `num.exp1`, increments by 1 (or by `step num.exp3` if specified), and continues until it reaches `num.exp2`. You can add optional `while` or `until` conditions to provide additional exit criteria. The loop continues until the ending condition is met or you explicitly exit with an `exit` or `goto` statement."}

Then the `for...next` loop iterates from 1 to that count, displaying each value with its index number. The `\"l#4\"` formats the index with left justification in a field of 4 characters, followed by the actual array value `array(13)<1,i>`."}

{"instruction": "How do I prevent multiple processes from running the same program simultaneously?", "input": "Syntax: lock lock.num{then|else statement.block}\n\nDescription: The lock statement sets one of 992 execution locks. This prevents re-entry to the program, allowing only one process to run the program at any given time.\n\nParameter: lock.num - Specifies the line number (from 0 to 991) to lock. If lock.num is greater than 991, the result is divided by 992, and the lock number is equal to the remainder of the equation.", "output": "Use the lock statement to prevent multiple processes from running the same program simultaneously. The syntax is `lock lock.num` where lock.num is a number from 0 to 991. This sets an execution lock that only allows one process to hold at a time. If another process attempts to acquire the same lock number while it's already held, that process will wait or take the else clause if specified. Numbers greater than 991 are automatically reduced using modulo 992. This is useful for preventing race conditions in critical program sections."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I try to acquire a lock that's already being used by another process?", "input": "Description: The lock statement sets one of 992 execution locks. This prevents re-entry to the program, allowing only one process to run the program at any given time. If present, the else clause is executed.\n\nExample 2: This example attempts to set lock 14. If it is already locked, the program advises the operator and stops.\nlock 14 else crt \"Program is locked\" ; stop", "output": "When you try to acquire a lock that's already held by another process, the lock statement will execute its else clause if one is provided. In the example:\n```\nlock 14 else crt \"Program is locked\" ; stop\n```\nIf lock 14 is already acquired by another process, the program will print \"Program is locked\" and stop execution. If no else clause is provided, the program will typically wait until the lock becomes available. This allows you to handle lock conflicts gracefully by providing appropriate user feedback or alternative program flow."}
{"instruction": "How would I create a loop that continues until a specific condition is met?", "input": "Syntax: loop {statement.block1} [until|while] logical.exp{do} {statement.block2} repeat\n\nDescription: The loop statement repetitively executes (loops) until an ending condition is met.

The first set of statements, if present, is executed at least once. The statements in the do clause are executed as long as the loop is executed. If while or until is specified, the do is required. If the until expression is initially true or the while expression is initially false, the statements specified in statement.block1 are executed at least once and those specified in statement.block2 are not executed.", "output": "In a loop construct, there are two distinct statement blocks:\n\n- **statement.block1** (before until/while): Executes at least once, regardless of the condition. Even if the until expression is initially true or the while expression is initially false, this block still runs once.\n\n- **statement.block2** (after do): Only executes when the loop condition allows continuation. If the condition would immediately terminate the loop, this block never executes.\n\nThis design ensures that any initialization or setup code in the first block always runs, while the main loop processing in the second block only runs when the condition permits continued looping."}
{"instruction": "Can you show me how to process all items in a select list using a loop?", "input": "Example: This processes an active list. When the last item-ID is read, the exit clause passes control to the next executable statement after the repeat statement. Notice the select list is the default active select list.\nexecute \"select customers\"\nloop\n   readnext item-ID else exit\n   print item-ID\nrepeat", "output": "Here's the example for processing a select list:\n```\nexecute \"select customers\"\nloop\n   readnext item-ID else exit\n   print item-ID\nrepeat\n```\nThis creates a select list of customer records, then loops through each item-ID. The readnext statement retrieves the next item-ID from the active select list. When there are no more items to read, readnext fails and triggers the else clause, which executes exit to break out of the loop. This pattern is commonly used to process all records that match a selection criteria."}

{"instruction": "What are the requirements when copying one matrix to another using mat?", "input": "Description: Array variables must be defined in a dim, common, or file statement.\n\nExample: When assigning one matrix to another, the array to the right of the equal sign must have the same total number of elements as the matrix to the left of the equal sign.\n\nDim array(5)\nqty = 10\nmat array = qty\n\ndim one(4,1)\nmat one = 1\ndim two(2,2)\nmat two = mat one", "output": "When copying one matrix to another using mat, these requirements must be met:\n\n1. **Both arrays must be previously defined** using dim, common, or file statements\n2. **Total element count must match** - the source and destination arrays must have the same total number of elements\n3. **Dimensional structure can differ** - you can copy between different dimensional arrangements (e.g., a 4×1 array to a 2×2 array) as long as the total elements match\n\nIn the example, `one(4,1)` has 4 elements and `two(2,2)` has 4 elements, so the copy operation `mat two = mat one` is valid even though they have different dimensional structures."}
{"instruction": "How does element assignment work when copying arrays with different dimensions?", "input": "Example: This example assigns all of the elements in the two dimensional array, a into the one dimensional array, b. The rows are filled before the columns, therefore a(2,1) = 2.\n\ndim a(10,2)\ndim b(20)\nmat b = 1\nb(3) = 2\nmat a = mat b", "output": "When copying between arrays of different dimensions, elements are assigned in row-major order (rows filled before columns).

{"instruction": "Explain how the on...gosub statement determines which subroutine to execute", "input": "on...gosub statement\nSyntax: on exp gosub statement.label{, statement.label...}\nDescription: The on... gosub statement transfers control to a local subroutine designated by a specific statement label according to the positional value returned by the expression. If required, the exp is truncated to an integer. The program executes the local subroutine at the statement.label that corresponds to exp. For example, if the expression evaluates to 1, the first subroutine is executed.", "output": "The on...gosub statement uses the numeric value of the expression (exp) to determine which subroutine to execute. The expression is truncated to an integer if necessary, and this value corresponds to the position in the comma-separated list of statement labels.

{"instruction": "What's the difference between on...goto and on...gosub statements?", "input": "on...goto statement\nSyntax: on exp goto statement.label{, statement.label...}\nDescription: The on...goto statement transfers control to the line within the FlashBASIC or BASIC program that begins with the specified statement label, according to the positional value of the expression referenced by exp. The on...goto is identical to the on...gosub, except there is no return required.", "output": "The on...goto statement is identical to on...gosub in terms of how it evaluates the expression and transfers control to the appropriate statement label. The key difference is that on...goto does not require a return statement - it permanently transfers control to the target label, while on...gosub expects the called subroutine to end with a return statement that brings execution back to the statement following the on...gosub."}

In this case, the file is opened and assigned to the default file variable. For example:\n\n```\nopen \"invoice.control\"\nreadv next.invoice-ID from \"invoice.counter\",1\n```\n\nNote that when using this approach, you can omit the file variable from subsequent read operations, as shown where `file.var` was left off the `readv` statement."}
{"instruction": "How does the out statement convert numeric values to characters?", "input": "out statement\nSyntax: out num.exp\nDescription: The out statement outputs a single ASCII character derived from a numeric expression in the range of 0 through 255, which indicates its corresponding position in the ASCII table. num.exp must evaluate to a decimal number. It is evaluated and adjusted (mod(expression,256)) to a value between 0 and 255.", "output": "The out statement converts numeric values to ASCII characters by taking the numeric expression, evaluating it as a decimal number, and then adjusting it using mod(expression,256) to ensure the result falls between 0 and 255. This final value corresponds to a position in the ASCII table, and the corresponding ASCII character is then output to the terminal."}
{"instruction": "What would happen if I use out with a number greater than 255?", "input": "out statement\nDescription: num.exp must evaluate to a decimal number. It is evaluated and adjusted (mod(expression,256)) to a value between 0 and 255. The corresponding ASCII character displays on the terminal.", "output": "If you use out with a number greater than 255, the system automatically adjusts it using modulo 256 arithmetic. For example, out 300 would be calculated as mod(300,256) = 44, so it would output the ASCII character corresponding to position 44. This ensures the result always falls within the valid ASCII range of 0-255."}
{"instruction": "How would I use out to ring the terminal bell?", "input": "out statement\nExample: This prints char(7) and rings the terminal bell.\nout 7", "output": "You can ring the terminal bell by using `out 7`.

{"instruction": "When would I use the page statement in a report program?", "input": "page statement\nSyntax: page {num.exp}\nDescription: The page statement terminates the current page of output, prints the optional footing, positions to the top of the form, and prints the optional heading.\nExample: heading \"this is a heading\"\nlines = dcount(item,char(254))\nfor i = 1 to lines\nl=item<i>\nif l[1,3]='.bp' then page else print l\nnext i", "output": "You would use the page statement in report programs when you need to control page breaks and formatting. It's particularly useful when processing data that might require page breaks at specific points. For example, in the given code, it checks if a line starts with '.bp' (break page) and issues a page command to start a new page, otherwise it prints the line normally. The page statement handles terminating the current page, printing any footer, moving to the top of the next page, and printing any header."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to change the page number when using the page statement?", "input": "page statement\nSyntax: page {num.exp}\nParameter: num.exp - Optional expression used to change the current value of the page number.", "output": "Yes, you can change the current page number by providing an optional numeric expression with the page statement.

{"instruction": "Why must the precision statement appear before any numeric data usage?", "input": "precision statement\nDescription: Only one precision statement is allowed in a program and it must precede the use of any numeric data. Programs calling subroutines or entering other programs must have the same precision. If the precisions do not match, the program aborts into the debugger.", "output": "The precision statement must appear before any numeric data usage because it defines the fundamental arithmetic behavior for the entire program. Since only one precision statement is allowed per program, and all called subroutines must have matching precision, it needs to be established before any numeric operations occur. If precisions don't match between calling and called programs, the program will abort into the debugger, making it critical to set this consistently at the beginning."}
{"instruction": "What happens when arithmetic operations exceed the 48-bit representation limit?", "input": "precision statement\nDescription: If the result of an arithmetic expression that divides (/), multiplies (*), takes a remainder (\\), or produces an exponent (^) exceeds the maximum magnitude of the 48-bit representation, the system creates an internal variable type that uses a precision of 18 digits to the right of the decimal point, and unlimited to the left. This feature assures maximum accuracy.", "output": "When arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, remainder, or exponentiation) exceed the 48-bit representation limit, the system automatically creates an internal variable type with enhanced precision. This special type uses 18 digits to the right of the decimal point and unlimited digits to the left, ensuring maximum accuracy is maintained even for very large or very precise calculations."}
{"instruction": "How would I set precision to 2 decimal places for financial calculations?", "input": "precision statement\nSyntax: precision num.constant\nExample: precision 2\nExample: precision 6\nprint 9999999/10000000\nOutput Result: 0.999999", "output": "To set precision to 2 decimal places for financial calculations, you would use `precision 2` at the beginning of your program before any numeric operations. This statement must appear before using any numeric data and ensures that all arithmetic operations in your program (and any called subroutines) will maintain 2 decimal places of precision, which is appropriate for monetary calculations."}
{"instruction": "What's the effect of setting precision to 0?", "input": "precision statement\nDescription: A precision of 0 forces 48-bit integer arithmetic for all operations. (99999/100000 results in a 0)", "output": "Setting precision to 0 forces 48-bit integer arithmetic for all operations, which means all fractional parts are truncated. For example, the division 99999/100000 would result in 0 instead of 0.99999, because the result is truncated to an integer. This setting is useful when you need pure integer arithmetic without any decimal precision."}
{"instruction": "How does the print statement handle different separators like commas and colons?", "input": "print statement\nSyntax: print {exp{,}{:}}{exp{,}{:}...}\nParameter: , - Defines 18-character tab stops at which comma-separated expressions are output left-aligned.\n: - Inhibits the output of a return and scroll following output of the last printed line.", "output": "The print statement handles separators differently: commas (,) define 18-character tab stops where expressions are output left-aligned, while colons (:) concatenate expressions together and inhibit the output of a return and scroll following the last printed line. This allows you to control both spacing and line termination in your output formatting."}
{"instruction": "When would I use the colon separator instead of comma in print statements?", "input": "print statement\nParameter: : - Inhibits the output of a return and scroll following output of the last printed line.\nExample: print message:' ':company.name", "output": "You would use the colon separator when you want to concatenate expressions together without automatic spacing or line breaks. The colon inhibits the return and scroll that normally follows print output, allowing you to build continuous output. For example, `print message:' ':company.name` concatenates the message variable, a space, and company.name into a single continuous output line."}
{"instruction": "How would I create formatted output with cursor positioning using print?", "input": "print statement\nExample: print @(10,10):'the amount is ' : (unit.price * qty) 'r#12'", "output": "You can create formatted output with cursor positioning by combining @() functions with print expressions. For example:\n\n```\nprint @(10,10):'the amount is ' : (unit.price * qty) 'r#12'\n```\n\nThis positions the cursor at column 10, row 10, displays the literal string 'the amount is', and then outputs the calculated amount right-aligned in a field of 12 characters. The @() function handles positioning while format codes like 'r#12' control alignment and field width."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between print and print on statements?", "input": "print on statement\nSyntax: print on print.file.num print.exp\nDescription: The print on statement directs output to one of 32,767 open print files.

The print file numbers can range from 0 to 31,999, and each represents a separate logical print file that gets assigned its own spool job number."}
{"instruction": "How does the printer statement control output routing?", "input": "printer statement\nSyntax: printer [on|off|close|num.exp]\nParameter: on - Directs output to the system printer, via the spooler.\noff - Directs output from subsequent print statements to the terminal.\nclose - Indicates that the current (printer) output is completed.", "output": "The printer statement controls where subsequent print, heading, footing, or page statements send their output. Using 'printer on' directs output to the system printer via the spooler, 'printer off' sends output back to the terminal, and 'printer close' indicates the current print job is complete and releases control to the spooler.

{"instruction": "When should I use readv versus reading an entire item?", "input": "readv statement\nDescription: The readv statement reads an item from the optionally-specified file variable and assigns the value contained in the attribute number referenced in the attribute expression to the specified variable. The readv statement reads the entire item into temporary workspace, extracts the targeted attribute, places it into the variable, and resets temporary space. The rest of the item is ignored. A series of readv statements against different attributes in the same item force the system to continually reread the same item. readv should be used only in cases where 1 or 2 attributes are needed from a larger item without the rest of the item. Using readv exclusively causes the program to run significantly slower.", "output": "Use readv only when you need 1 or 2 attributes from a larger item and don't need the rest of the data. While readv reads the entire item into temporary workspace, it only extracts the targeted attribute and discards the rest. Multiple readv statements against different attributes in the same item cause inefficient re-reading of the same data. For better performance, read the entire item once if you need multiple attributes, as using readv exclusively will make your program run significantly slower."}

{"instruction": "What's the proper way to release item locks after reading with readvu?", "input": "release statement\nSyntax: release {file.var,} {ID.exp}\nDescription: The release statement clears locks on items locked with a previous matreadu, readu, or readvu statement.\nExample: In the following example, an item is read from the customer file and locked. If a new name is entered, the name attribute is changed, a date stamp is placed in attribute 20, and the item is written, automatically clearing the item lock. If no name is entered, no write occurs, requiring the item lock to be cleared with the release statement.\nreadu item from customer.file,item-ID then\n    input name\n    if name # '' then\n       item<1>=name\n       item<20>=date()\n       write item on customer.file,item-ID\n    end else\n       release customer.file,item-ID\n    end\n end", "output": "Use the release statement with syntax 'release {file.var,} {ID.exp}' to clear locks from items locked by matreadu, readu, or readvu statements. The release is necessary when you don't perform a write operation, as write automatically clears the lock. In the example, if no new name is entered, 'release customer.file,item-ID' explicitly clears the lock, preventing the item from remaining locked indefinitely."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to add comments to FlashBASIC programs for documentation?", "input": "rem statement\nSyntax: rem text\nDescription: The rem statement designates that all text that follows the statement on the same line is ignored by the compiler.

Initialize position.var to zero before the first call. Each call extracts the next delimited substring into var, updates position.var to the end of the current substring, and sets delimiter.var to a code indicating which delimiter was found.

{"instruction": "When would I need to use the replace statement for maintaining database integrity?", "input": "replace statement\nSyntax: replace file.var, item-ID.old with item-ID.new\nDescription: The replace statement maintains referential integrity between items that contain bidirectional bridges used by the Update processor by eliminating duplicate item-IDs. item-ID.new replaces item-ID.old in bridged-to items. item-ID.old is deleted after replacement. In order for the database to be consistent, there should be two-way bridges between the references.", "output": "Use the replace statement when you need to maintain referential integrity in databases with bidirectional bridges and eliminate duplicate item-IDs. The syntax 'replace file.var, item-ID.old with item-ID.new' replaces all occurrences of the old item-ID with the new one in bridged-to items, then deletes the old item. This is essential when consolidating duplicate records while preserving all cross-references. The database must have consistent two-way bridges between references for this to work properly."}
{"instruction": "How does the return statement work differently in internal versus external subroutines?", "input": "return statement\nSyntax: return\nreturn {to statement.label}\nDescription: The return statement terminates an internal or external subroutine, and returns execution control to the statement following the invoking call or gosub statement. The to clause can only be used with an internal subroutine, and transfers control to the specified statement label. This is not a recommended programming practice.", "output": "The return statement works differently depending on the subroutine type. For both internal and external subroutines, 'return' terminates the subroutine and returns control to the statement following the call or gosub. However, the 'return to statement.label' form can only be used with internal subroutines to transfer control to a specific statement label instead of the normal return point. This practice is not recommended as it can make code harder to follow and maintain."}
{"instruction": "What happens to local variables when returning from an external subroutine on Windows?", "input": "return statement\nParameter: For Windows: Locally defined variables in external subroutines (and files opened to local file variables) are automatically abandoned or closed on return.", "output": "On Windows systems, locally defined variables in external subroutines are automatically abandoned when the return statement executes. Additionally, any files that were opened to local file variables are automatically closed. This automatic cleanup ensures that resources are properly released when the external subroutine terminates, preventing memory leaks and file handle exhaustion."}
{"instruction": "How do I make my process sleep until a specific time rather than for a duration?", "input": "sleep statement\nSyntax: sleep {num.exp}\nsleep {\"time.exp\"}\nDescription: The sleep statement places a process to sleep for a specific number of seconds, or, until a specific time. If no argument is included, the process sleeps for one second. The specification of fractional seconds in the numeric expression is allowed. Also, a numeric expression of 0 causes the process to relinquish its time slice.\nExample: This puts the process to sleep, leaving a wakeup call for 8:00 AM.\nuntil.wakeup.time = \"08:00\"\nsleep until.wakeup.time", "output": "Use the sleep statement with a time expression in military time format (hh:mm:ss). For example:\n\n```\nuntil.wakeup.time = \"08:00\"\nsleep until.wakeup.time\n```\n\nThis puts the process to sleep until 8:00 AM. The time expression should be in quotes and use military time format. You can also include seconds like \"08:30:15\" for 8:30:15 AM. This differs from using a numeric expression, which specifies duration in seconds."}
{"instruction": "Why would I use sleep 0 in my program?", "input": "sleep statement\nDescription: Also, a numeric expression of 0 causes the process to relinquish its time slice.", "output": "Use 'sleep 0' to make your process voluntarily relinquish its time slice to other processes. This doesn't actually pause execution for any measurable time, but allows the operating system to give CPU time to other waiting processes. This is useful in tight loops or processing-intensive operations where you want to be a good citizen and not monopolize system resources."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between stop and abort statements for error handling?", "input": "stop statement\nSyntax: stop\nstop errnum, \"parameter\"{,\"parameter\"...}\nDescription: The stop statement stops program execution and returns to the invoking the process. The parameters are passed to the error message handler and the message stored in errnum displays. The stop statement is similar to the abort statement, except the stop statement terminates execution of the program without going into the FlashBASIC or BASIC debugger. Control returns to the calling program, Proc, or macro.", "output": "The key difference is that stop terminates program execution and returns control to the calling program, Proc, or macro without entering the debugger, while abort enters the FlashBASIC or BASIC debugger. Use stop when you want clean program termination with optional error messages (using errnum and parameters), and abort when you want to drop into the debugger for troubleshooting."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to display a custom error message when a file can't be opened.", "input": "stop statement example: The stop statement below stops program execution if invoices cannot be opened, and prints the designated error message with a passed variable parameter.\nopen \"invoices\" to inv.file else stop 201,\"invoices\"\nIf the invoices file does not exist, this message displays:\n[201] 'invoices' is not a file name", "output": "Use stop with an error number and parameter to display custom error messages:\n\n```\nopen \"invoices\" to inv.file else stop 201,\"invoices\"\n```\n\nThis displays '[201] 'invoices' is not a file name' if the file cannot be opened.

{"instruction": "What special considerations apply when subroutines are called from the Update processor?", "input": "subroutine statement\nDescription: If a subroutine is called from the Update processor, in either a file-defining item, or an attribute-defining item, no arg.list can be specified by the call statement. If called from a file-defining item, the item being filed is automatically passed as a parameter in a call. If called from an attribute-defining item, the current value of the attribute being processed is automatically passed. Note that the subroutine is called once for every value in the attribute.", "output": "When subroutines are called from the Update processor, special parameter passing rules apply. No argument list can be specified in the call statement. If called from a file-defining item, the entire item being filed is automatically passed as a parameter. If called from an attribute-defining item, only the current attribute value is passed, and importantly, the subroutine is called once for every value within that attribute. This automatic parameter passing eliminates the need for explicit argument lists in Update processor contexts."}
{"instruction": "How can I execute a TCL command from within my FlashBASIC program and capture its output?", "input": "The tcl statement executes any valid TCL command as a subroutine. After execution, the FlashBASIC or BASIC program continues with the next statement. Input can be passed to the TCL statements using the data statement prior to the tcl statement. The to modifier passes the last message number and arguments of the tcl statement to the specified dimensioned array variable.

To capture output, use the 'to' modifier with a dimensioned array variable: 'tcl 'your-command' to results'. The array will receive the last message number and arguments from the TCL command execution."}
{"instruction": "What happens to the data queue when I use multiple tcl statements in my program?", "input": "After the tcl statement is completed, the data queue (stack) is reset. Multiple data statements can be passed when they are separated by value marks. Multiple tcl statements can be passed when they are separated by attribute marks. If an active list is generated by the tcl statement, it is passed back to the FlashBASIC or BASIC program.", "output": "The data queue (stack) is automatically reset after each tcl statement completes. You can pass multiple data statements by separating them with value marks, and multiple tcl statements by separating them with attribute marks. Any active list generated by the tcl statement will be passed back to your FlashBASIC program for use with readnext statements."}
{"instruction": "Show me a practical example of using the tcl statement with an AQL command.", "input": "Example: This example executes an AQL count command and returns the error message item-IDs to the dimensioned array, results. dim results(3)\ntcl 'count md if a1 \"pq\"' to results\nThe output displays as: [407] 26 items counted out of 897 items\nThe contents of results displays as: results(1) = 407, results(2) = 26, results(3) = 897", "output": "Here's a practical example:\n```\ndim results(3)\ntcl 'count md if a1 \"pq\"' to results\n```\nThis executes an AQL count command and captures the results. The output '[407] 26 items counted out of 897 items' gets parsed into the array: results(1) = 407 (message number), results(2) = 26 (items counted), results(3) = 897 (total items)."}
{"instruction": "Under what circumstances would the tcl statement not return control to my program?", "input": "If the TCL off command is issued as the tcl statement, control does not return to the FlashBASIC or BASIC program.", "output": "Control will not return to your FlashBASIC or BASIC program if you execute 'tcl \"off\"' as your tcl statement. The TCL off command terminates the session, so your program execution will not continue beyond that point."}
{"instruction": "How do I retrieve the original TCL command that was used to start my program?", "input": "The tclread statement loads the TCL command used to activate the program into a variable. The program must be the program called from TCL. The tclread statement does not work when called from a subroutine or from enter or tcl statements. Syntax: tclread var", "output": "Use the tclread statement with the syntax 'tclread var' where var is the variable that will receive the TCL command. This only works when your program is directly called from TCL - it won't work from subroutines or when called via enter or tcl statements. You can then use the field() function to extract individual parameters from the command line."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to extract individual parameters from the TCL command line in my program?", "input": "This statement allows parameters to be passed from TCL to a program directly without processing. Individual parameters can be extracted using the field() function. The tclread statement loads the TCL command used to activate the program into a variable.", "output": "Yes, after using tclread to load the TCL command into a variable, you can extract individual parameters using the field() function. The tclread statement captures the entire command line, allowing you to parse parameters directly without additional processing."}
{"instruction": "When should I use the timeout statement in my mvBase programs?", "input": "mvBase Only: The timeout statement specifies the number of seconds the operating environment waits for terminal input before a timeout condition occurs. If a timeout occurs and an ELSE clause is specified on the INPUT statement, the ELSE clause is carried out. Syntax: timeout exp", "output": "Use the timeout statement in mvBase when you need to limit how long your program waits for user input. Set it with 'timeout seconds' before INPUT statements. If the timeout expires and your INPUT statement has an ELSE clause, that clause will execute. Otherwise, the program continues waiting for input."}
{"instruction": "How can I disable the timeout feature in my program?", "input": "If the exp variable is set to zero, the timeout waiting feature is turned off. Examples: TIMEOUT 30 - A 30-second timeout is established for subsequent input statements. TIMEOUT 'LOGGED OFF' - Error: An expression cannot be used as parameter. TIMEOUT - Error: The number of seconds must be specified.", "output": "To disable the timeout feature, set the timeout value to zero: 'timeout 0'. This turns off timeout waiting for all subsequent input statements. Note that you must specify a numeric value - expressions in quotes will cause an error, and the timeout statement requires a parameter."}
{"instruction": "What's the purpose of the transaction statement in FlashBASIC applications?", "input": "The transaction statement enables or disables participation in a transaction. This functionality is intended for languages built on top of FlashBASIC or BASIC (like some SQL engines or 4GLs) that need to use temporary files for internal reasons without affecting a user-level transaction. Syntax: transaction [on|off|exp]", "output": "The transaction statement controls whether your program participates in transactions. It's primarily designed for higher-level languages built on FlashBASIC (like SQL engines or 4GLs) that need to use temporary files internally without affecting user-level transactions. Use 'transaction on' to enable or 'transaction off' to disable participation."}
{"instruction": "How does the expression parameter work with the transaction statement?", "input": "The term on or off is required if an expression is used with this function. exp - Transaction is turned on if the expression evaluates to nonzero (true) and turned off if it evaluates to 0 (false).", "output": "When using an expression with the transaction statement, the transaction is enabled if the expression evaluates to nonzero (true) and disabled if it evaluates to 0 (false). You must include either 'on' or 'off' keywords when using an expression parameter."}
{"instruction": "Why would I want to disable the transaction read cache?", "input": "The transaction cache statement enables or disables the transaction read cache. Users can turn this cache off if they are confident that the transaction does not attempt this activity. Turning the cache off can improve the performance of reads within a transaction, especially if the transaction is particularly long. Once the cache is turned off, it remains off until the program completes.", "output": "Disable the transaction read cache to improve read performance in long transactions when you're confident your transaction won't re-read items that have already been written. Use 'transaction cache off' to disable it. This prevents the overhead of checking uncommitted updates for every read operation, but once disabled, it stays off for the entire program execution."}
{"instruction": "What happens when the transaction read cache is enabled?", "input": "Normally, all read operations within a transaction first query the list of uncommitted updates. This allows the re-reading of an item already written. The transaction cache statement enables or disables the transaction read cache.", "output": "When the transaction read cache is enabled (default behavior), all read operations within a transaction first check the list of uncommitted updates before reading from the actual file. This allows you to re-read items that have already been written within the same transaction, ensuring consistency but with some performance overhead."}
{"instruction": "Under what conditions might I disable transaction flushing, and what are the risks?", "input": "The transaction flush statement enables or disables the transaction flush mechanism. If ACID compliance is not necessary, then this flush mechanism can be disabled, providing significantly higher performance. If the flush is disabled and the machine halts, all pending transactions are aborted in a potentially semi-committed state.", "output": "Disable transaction flushing with 'transaction flush off' when ACID compliance isn't required and you need higher performance. However, this is risky: if the machine halts unexpectedly, all pending transactions may be aborted in a semi-committed state, potentially causing data corruption. Only disable flushing when data durability isn't critical."}
{"instruction": "What does ACID compliance mean in the context of transaction flushing?", "input": "Normally, all updates processed within a transaction are force-flushed to a reliable medium (disk). This is done to assure ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable) compliance, that is, the ability to recover a transaction if the machine should halt unexpectedly.", "output": "ACID compliance ensures transactions are Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable. The transaction flush mechanism force-flushes all updates to disk to guarantee the 'Durable' aspect - meaning transactions can be recovered if the machine halts unexpectedly. This is why updates are written to reliable storage rather than kept only in memory."}
{"instruction": "How do I release specific execution locks versus all locks in my program?", "input": "The unlock statement resets an execution lock, previously set with a lock statement. Syntax: unlock, unlock lock.num.exp. lock.num.exp - Specifies which execution lock (from 0 to 991) to reset. If not specified, all locks set by the program are unlocked.", "output": "To release a specific execution lock, use 'unlock lock_number' where lock_number is between 0 and 991. To release all locks set by your program, simply use 'unlock' without any parameters. This will reset all execution locks that were previously set with lock statements."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to properly implement a file update with execution locking.", "input": "Example: This conditionally sets execution lock 12 just before a segment of code that performs file retrieval and update. When complete, lock 12 is cleared by the unlock statement.\nagain: lock 12 else rqm; goto again\nread rec from file,ID else print ID:' not found'; rec = 'X'\nwrite rec on file,ID\nunlock 12", "output": "Here's the proper pattern for file updates with locking:\n```\nagain: lock 12 else rqm; goto again\nread rec from file,ID else print ID:' not found'; rec = 'X'  \nwrite rec on file,ID\nunlock 12\n```\nThis sets execution lock 12, performs the file operations, then releases the lock. The 'again' loop ensures the lock is obtained before proceeding with the critical file update section."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between using 'else' and 'onerr' clauses with the weof statement?", "input": "The weof statement writes an eof (end of file) mark to the currently attached magnetic media. The then clause is executed if the operation was successful. If the operation was unsuccessful, the else or onerr clause is executed. The onerr clause can be used to check for tape error conditions by interrogating the system(0) function. Either else or onerr can be specified, but not both.", "output": "Both 'else' and 'onerr' clauses execute when the weof operation fails, but you can only specify one. The key difference is that 'onerr' allows you to check specific tape error conditions using the system(0) function, while 'else' is for general error handling. Use 'onerr' when you need to interrogate the specific type of tape error that occurred."}
{"instruction": "How would I handle writing multiple tape files with EOF markers?", "input": "Example subroutine showing a series of tape files written using items in a previously formatted disk file. When a null item is encountered, the logic assumes that an eof is to be written to tape. Two eof marks indicate an end-of-data condition. The subroutine includes: execute 't-att ':blocksize, weof else err=system(0), and writing 2 eof's at end-of-tape.", "output": "Handle multiple tape files by checking for null items in your source data - when found, write an EOF marker with 'weof else err=system(0)'. At the end of all data, write two consecutive EOF marks to indicate end-of-data condition. Use system(0) to capture any tape errors during the weof operations. Attach the tape first with 'execute 't-att ':blocksize' before beginning the write process."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I use the 'on error' clause with write statements?", "input": "If the file updated performs a callx correlative and that subroutine does an inputerr, then the FlashBASIC program performing the write command drops immediately to TCL in the default case. If the on error.clause is present, then that clause is taken in the inputerr case. An optional on error.clause can be specified, which consists of the clause 'on error' followed by a statement block.", "output": "The 'on error' clause prevents your program from dropping to TCL when a write operation encounters an inputerr from a callx correlative. Without the error clause, an inputerr causes immediate termination to TCL. With 'on error', your specified statement block executes instead, allowing you to handle the error gracefully within your program."}
{"instruction": "When should I use writeu instead of write for file operations?", "input": "The writeu form of the write command writes a dynamic array into the specified file variable and keeps items locked that were locked by a previous readu, readvu, or matreadu command. Because a writeu does not clear the item lock, a release or an explicit write is required to clear the lock before continuing.", "output": "Use writeu when you need to maintain item locks that were set by previous readu, readvu, or matreadu operations. This is essential for maintaining data integrity in multi-user environments. Remember that writeu doesn't clear the item lock, so you must explicitly use 'release' or a regular 'write' statement to clear the lock when you're finished with the item."}
{"instruction": "What are the performance implications of using writev for multiple attributes?", "input": "writev requires that the entire item be read into temporary workspace so that it can be rebuilt with the new attribute value, before it is written back to the file. A series of writev statements addressing different attributes in the same item can get very slow because the item has to be reread for every writev.", "output": "Using multiple writev statements on the same item creates significant performance issues because each writev must read the entire item, rebuild it with the new attribute value, and write it back. For multiple attributes in the same item, it's more efficient to read the item once, modify all needed attributes in memory, then write the complete item back with a single write statement."}
{"instruction": "How can I append a new attribute to the end of an item using writev?", "input": "The writev statement writes the value of an expression into the attribute designated in the attribute expression parameter. -1 can be used as the value of the attribute count expression. This appends a new attribute to the end of the item. Syntax: writev exp ON {file.var,} ID.exp, ac.exp", "output": "To append a new attribute to the end of an item, use -1 as the attribute count expression: 'writev new_value ON file.var, item.id, -1'. This special value tells writev to add the new attribute at the end rather than replacing an existing attribute at a specific position."}
{"instruction": "What information does the u0004 user exit provide about terminal settings?", "input": "The u0004 user exit returns term settings in dynamic array format. Example: result = oconv('','u4'); print result outputs: wy-50^79^80^24^59^0^1^1^8^", "output": "The u0004 user exit returns terminal settings as a dynamic array with values separated by '^' characters. From the example 'wy-50^79^80^24^59^0^1^1^8^', this includes terminal type, dimensions, and various configuration parameters. Use 'result = oconv(\"\",\"u0004\")' to retrieve these settings for terminal-specific program behavior."}
{"instruction": "How do I handle binary data with segment marks when using the u007a user exit?", "input": "Because a FlashBASIC or BASIC program cannot handle segment mark (decimal 255) characters, a special encoding scheme is used. A segment mark is replaced by the special two character sequence dle_, where dle is a data link escape character (decimal 16). These special sequences are replaced: dle dle - Replaced by one dle, dle_ - Replaced by one segment mark, dle xx - Replaced by one or more segment marks.", "output": "The u007a user exit uses DLE (Data Link Escape, decimal 16) encoding for binary data containing segment marks. Use these sequences: 'dle + dle' for a literal DLE character, 'dle + _' for one segment mark, and 'dle + xx' for multiple segment marks where xx is the count (1-126) plus 128. This allows FlashBASIC programs to handle binary data that would otherwise be impossible to process."}
{"instruction": "What do the return codes mean when using the u007a user exit for binary items?", "input": "code - Return code: >0 Number of frames allocated to hold the binary item, -1 Not enough overflow, -2 Illegal dle sequence, -3 Illegal file reference. The size does not include the special dle escape sequences, but it should include the number of segment marks after decompression.", "output": "The u007a user exit return codes indicate: positive numbers show frames allocated for the binary item (success), -1 means insufficient overflow space available, -2 indicates an illegal DLE encoding sequence in your data, and -3 means the file reference is invalid. The size parameter should reflect the final decompressed size including actual segment marks, not the encoded DLE sequences."}
{"instruction": "How can I check the where status and return stack information for a specific PCB?", "input": "Syntax: result = oconv(pcb.num, 'u0079')\nDescription: The u0079 user exit returns the where status for the specified PCB (Process Control Block) FID, and its return stack information.\nExample: b = oconv('02c0', 'u0079') - 02c0 is the PCB (which happens to be port 0) to examine.", "output": "Use the u0079 user exit with the oconv function. Pass the PCB number as the first parameter and 'u0079' as the conversion code. For example: result = oconv(pcb.num, 'u0079'). This will return the where status for the specified PCB FID and its return stack information."}

It provides details about the current state and call stack of the process associated with that PCB."}
{"instruction": "Give me an example of using the u0079 user exit to examine port 0.", "input": "Syntax: result = oconv(pcb.num, 'u0079')\nDescription: The u0079 user exit returns the where status for the specified PCB (Process Control Block) FID, and its return stack information.\nExample: b = oconv('02c0', 'u0079') - 02c0 is the PCB (which happens to be port 0) to examine.", "output": "To examine port 0 using the u0079 user exit, use: b = oconv('02c0', 'u0079'). Here, '02c0' is the PCB (which happens to be port 0) that you want to examine. The result will contain the where status and return stack information for that port."}

{"instruction": "Can you walk me through a practical authentication scenario using u71?", "input": "Example: Suppose you want your application to manage whether or not a user will be prompted for logon credentials, but would still like to utilize Host Authentication when a challenge is required. To implement this configuration, make sure the default HAForceCheck value is disabled, which will send telnet users straight to the D3 md prompt without challenging for logon credentials. The user macro in the users item should run your application. In other words, the user does not get access to TCL. Your application will do whatever checks you want it to do to test whether the user will be challenged.", "output": "Here's a practical authentication flow:\n\n1. Set default HAForceCheck to disabled (users go straight to D3 prompt)\n2. Configure user macro to run your application (no TCL access)\n3. In your application:\n   - Test if oconv(\"2\", \"u71\") returns 1 (credentials already checked)\n   - Identify user's IP address (using nt_pinfo on Windows, !d3 qn on Unix)\n   - If IP is trusted, continue normally\n   - If IP is untrusted or unknown:\n     * Call oconv(\"1\", \"u71\") to enable HAForceCheck\n     * Chain \"off\" to force re-authentication\n     * User will be challenged for credentials on reconnection\n     * oconv(\"2\", \"u71\") will return 1 after successful authentication\n\nThis gives you application-controlled authentication based on IP trust levels."}

This function returns the number of bytes actually written. If the length of var is less than size, the content of the string written is undefined, as is usual in C. No data translation occurs.", "output": "If you specify a size larger than the variable length in %write(), the content of the string written becomes undefined, similar to C behavior. This means you cannot predict what data will be written beyond the actual length of your variable.

This function returns the number of bytes actually written. If the length of var is less than size, the content of the string written is undefined, as is usual in C. No data translation occurs.", "output": "The key difference is that %write() performs no data translation - it writes raw bytes exactly as they exist in memory. Other file writing operations might perform character set conversions, line ending translations, or other data transformations. %write() bypasses all of these and writes the exact binary content, making it suitable for binary data or when you need precise control over what gets written to the file."}

The $* directive directs the compiler to write the quoted text directly into the object code of the program. These comments are generally used to place copyright information or version numbers into object code before it is distributed.", "output": "You would embed text in object code using $* rather than regular comments because regular comments are stripped out during compilation and don't appear in the final executable.

{"instruction": "Why might a uopen command fail even if the file exists?", "input": "uopen command - One reason that the uopen command may fail is that the user attempting to open the file does not have the necessary permissions. For example, if the file contains confidential information that the user is not authorized to read, the uopen command does not open the file. The ELSE clause executes instead.", "output": "The UOPEN command can fail even with existing files due to insufficient permissions. If the user lacks the necessary authorization to read, write, or access the file (such as confidential files or system-protected files), the UOPEN command will fail and execute the ELSE clause. Always include proper error handling to catch permission-related failures."}

Example: *? conv L 1 object verifies. where conv is the name of the program being executed and L 1 indicates that line one of the program is about to be executed. If the conv program had been flashed (compiled with the o option), the message produced by the ? command is: *? conv L 1 FlashBASIC object verifies.", "output": "The ? command displays:\n\n1. Current program name (e.g., 'conv')\n2. Current line number (e.g., 'L 1' for line 1)\n3. Object verification status\n\nFor regular BASIC: \"conv L 1 object verifies\"\nFor FlashBASIC (compiled): \"conv L 1 FlashBASIC object verifies\"\n\nThe 'L 1' indicates line 1 is about to be executed. This helps you understand exactly where you are in the program execution flow."}
{"instruction": "How can I execute TCL commands while debugging a BASIC program?", "input": "> command - The > command executes any TCL command typed concatenated after the > and returns to the BASIC debugger. Example: >who56 ref bob", "output": "Use the > command followed by any TCL command. For example:\n\n>who56 ref bob\n\nThis executes the TCL command 'who56 ref bob' and then returns control to the BASIC debugger. This allows you to run system commands, check user information, or perform other TCL operations without leaving the debugging session."}
{"instruction": "What types of breakpoint conditions can I set, and what operators are supported?", "input": "b command (FlashBASIC Debugger) - The b command establishes a breakpoint condition in the breakpoint table that causes the program to enter the BASIC/FlashBASIC debugger when the condition defined in the breakpoint expression is met. The valid comparative operators are: >, <, and =.

{"instruction": "How does the 'exk' command differ from 'ex' in the editor?", "input": "Syntax: exk\n\nDescription: The exk command exits the current item without saving changes and returns control directly to TCL, abandoning any active list, if present.", "output": "The 'exk' command differs from 'ex' in that it:\n\n**exk command**:\n- Exits current item without saving\n- Returns directly to TCL immediately\n- Abandons any remaining items in an active list\n- Terminates the entire editing session\n\n**ex command**:\n- Exits current item without saving\n- Continues to next item if list exists\n- Only returns to TCL after processing all items\n\nUse 'exk' when you want to completely abandon an editing session, especially when working with multiple items and you don't want to process the remaining ones."}
{"instruction": "How can I save my current work without exiting the Editor?", "input": "The fs command saves a copy of the current item and remains in the Editor within the current item. It is essentially the same as the fi command, but does not exit the item. When editing large items, periodically issue an fs command to ensure an update to the file. A different file reference and/or item-ID may be specified prior to saving the item. Syntax: fs{(file.reference}{item-ID}", "output": "Use the fs command to save a copy of the current item while remaining in the Editor. This command works like the fi command but doesn't exit the item. When working with large items, you should periodically use fs to ensure your changes are saved to the file. You can optionally specify a different file reference and/or item-ID before saving."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between fs and fso commands when saving items?", "input": "The fs command saves a copy of the current item and remains in the Editor within the current item. The fso command saves the current item and overwrites the item when a duplicate item-ID already exists on file. This form is used when specifying an item-ID other than the one originally requested.", "output": "The fs command saves a copy of the current item without overwriting existing items, while the fso command saves the current item and will overwrite any existing item with the same item-ID. Use fso when you want to overwrite a pre-existing item or when specifying an item-ID different from the one originally requested."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to create a backup copy of an item with a different name", "input": "Example: Makes a backup copy of main.program, calling the new copy main.program.original. This is useful in making historical copies or saving originals under different names prior to making changes without leaving the Editor. Command: ed bp main.program top.fs main.program.original", "output": "To create a backup copy with a different name, use the fs command with the new item-ID. For example: 'fs main.program.original' will create a backup copy of main.program called main.program.original. This is useful for making historical copies or saving originals under different names before making changes, all without leaving the Editor."}
{"instruction": "When would I need to use the fso command instead of fs?", "input": "The fso command saves the current item and overwrites the item when a duplicate item-ID already exists on file. Example shows: 'ed bp main.program top.fs main.program.original cmnd?' indicating the item was already on file, and 'It can be overwritten as: .fso main.program.original'", "output": "Use the fso command when you need to overwrite an existing item. If you try to use fs and get a 'cmnd?' error message, it means the item already exists on file. In this case, use fso to force the overwrite. For example, if 'fs main.program.original' fails because the item exists, use '.fso main.program.original' to overwrite it."}
{"instruction": "How do I jump to a specific line number in the Editor?", "input": "The g command positions the line pointer to a specific line. The attribute number (line number) may be entered without the g command. Syntax: {g}line.number. Example: g25", "output": "Use the g command followed by the line number to jump to a specific line. For example, 'g25' positions the line pointer to line 25. You can also enter just the line number without the g command - both methods work to position the line pointer to the specified attribute number."}
{"instruction": "Is there a way to view the content in hexadecimal format?", "input": "The h command toggles the display between ASCII and hexadecimal-encoded ASCII. While editing an item, type the h command to toggle the display for the current line and any subsequent line displays until the h command is typed again.", "output": "Yes, use the h command to toggle between ASCII and hexadecimal display. When you type 'h', it switches the display to show hexadecimal-encoded ASCII for the current line and all subsequent displays. Type 'h' again to return to normal ASCII display. This is display-only - when using commands like l (search) or r (replace), ASCII is still assumed."}
{"instruction": "Show me an example of how the hex display works", "input": "Example: :ed customers 1 top 001 Comp Products 002 10 Executive Dr 003 Farmington .h hex display on 004 436F6E6E65637469637574 005 3036303332 006 526F62657274205065746572736F6E .h hex display off 007 Operations Manager", "output": "Here's how hex display works: When you enter '.h', the display switches to hexadecimal mode. For example, line 004 shows '436F6E6E65637469637574' in hex instead of 'Connecticut' in ASCII. Line 005 shows '3036303332' instead of '06032'. When you type '.h' again, it returns to normal ASCII display, showing 'Operations Manager' on line 007 in readable text."}
{"instruction": "How can I enter multiple lines of text at once?", "input": "The i command places the Editor into insert mode to enter one or more lines. Pressing Enter at the first position of a line while in insert mode returns control to command mode. Examples: Inserting multiple lines with each text string (new line) delimited with an attribute mark (control shift^): i newline1^newline2^newline3", "output": "Use the i command to enter insert mode for adding multiple lines. You can insert multiple lines at once by separating each line with an attribute mark (^). For example: 'i newline1^newline2^newline3' will insert three separate lines. To exit insert mode and return to command mode, press Enter at the first position of a line."}
{"instruction": "What's the syntax for inserting a single line versus multiple lines?", "input": "The i command syntax for inserting: Single line: i string or i nnn+string nnn+. Inserting a null line: i. Inserting multiple lines: i newline1^newline2^newline3", "output": "For a single line, use 'i string' or the format 'i' followed by 'nnn+string' and 'nnn+'. To insert a null (empty) line, just use 'i' by itself. For multiple lines, use 'i newline1^newline2^newline3' where each ^ (attribute mark) separates the lines you want to insert."}
{"instruction": "How do I copy lines from another item into my current item?", "input": "The me command merges one or more lines from the current item, another item in the current file, or another item in a different file.

Parameters: #lines specifies number of lines to merge, item-ID specifies the item, start.attr specifies starting line number, file.reference specifies different file.", "output": "Use the me command to merge (copy) lines from other items. The syntax is 'me{#lines}/{item-ID}{/{start.attr}}' for items in the same file, or 'me{#lines}(file.reference {item-ID})start.attr}}' for items in different files. Specify the number of lines to copy, the source item-ID, and optionally the starting line number. If parameters are omitted, it defaults to copying one line from the current item starting at line 1."}
{"instruction": "Show me examples of merging lines from different sources", "input": "Examples: me10// merges 10 lines from the current item, beginning with line number 1. me10/abc/3 merges 10 lines from the item called abc, beginning with line number 3. me22(appdoc prog.doc)10 merges 22 lines from the item called prog.doc, that resides in the file appdoc, beginning with line number 10.", "output": "Here are merge examples: 'me10//' copies 10 lines from the current item starting at line 1. 'me10/abc/3' copies 10 lines from item 'abc' starting at line 3. 'me22(appdoc prog.doc)10' copies 22 lines from item 'prog.doc' in file 'appdoc' starting at line 10. The format changes depending on whether you're copying from the current item, another item in the same file, or an item in a different file."}
{"instruction": "How do I move down several lines at once?", "input": "The n command positions the line pointer down a specified number of lines from the current position. Followed by pressing ENTER, the n command redisplays the current line. n1 is the same as pressing ENTER in Editor. Syntax: n{number.lines}. Example: n0 014 print customer-ID. n4 018 print", "output": "Use the n command followed by the number of lines to move down. For example, 'n4' moves the line pointer down 4 lines from the current position. If you follow the n command with pressing ENTER, it will redisplay the current line. Note that 'n1' is equivalent to just pressing ENTER in the Editor."}
{"instruction": "What are prestored commands and how do I define them?", "input": "The p command either defines or executes a pre-stored command; p by itself assumes p0 (zero). Examples: p1 b[u22[l22 defines pre-stored command p1 with the command sequence: Go to the bottom of the item, Move the line pointer up 22 lines, List 22 lines. Each time the p1 command is issued, the last 22 lines of the item display.", "output": "Prestored commands let you define and execute command sequences. Use 'p' followed by a number to define a prestored command buffer. For example, 'p1 b[u22[l22' defines prestored command p1 that goes to bottom (b), moves up 22 lines (u22), and lists 22 lines (l22). Each time you type 'p1', it will execute this sequence to display the last 22 lines of the item."}
{"instruction": "How can I view what prestored commands I have defined?", "input": "The pd command displays any prestored command. Pre-stored commands are defined using the p command and are lost each time the Editor returns to TCL. Example: ed bp print.invoices top.pd P0 L22", "output": "Use the pd command to display all currently defined prestored commands. For example, typing 'pd' might show 'P0 L22' indicating that prestored command P0 is defined to list 22 lines. Remember that prestored commands are temporary and are lost when the Editor returns to TCL."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between r and ru for replacing text?", "input": "The r command replaces strings in lines. Only the first occurrence of the old string is replaced with the new string. The ru form replaces all (universal) occurrences. Examples: r10/abc/xyz replaces the first occurrence of 'abc' with 'xyz' in current and next 9 lines. ru10/abc/xyz replaces all occurrences of 'abc' with 'xyz' in current and next 9 lines.", "output": "The r command replaces only the first occurrence of a string in each line, while ru (universal replace) replaces all occurrences. For example, 'r10/abc/xyz' replaces just the first 'abc' with 'xyz' in the current and next 9 lines, but 'ru10/abc/xyz' replaces every occurrence of 'abc' with 'xyz' in those same lines."}
{"instruction": "How do I replace text within specific column ranges?", "input": "The r command syntax includes column range specification: r{u}{#lines}/old.string/new.string{/{start.col{-end.col}}}. Example: r10/abc/xyz/5-9 replaces the first occurrence of the string 'abc' with the string 'xyz' in the current and next nine lines when the string is found in column positions 5 through 9.", "output": "Add column range specification to the r command using the format '/start.col-end.col'. For example, 'r10/abc/xyz/5-9' will replace 'abc' with 'xyz' only when found in columns 5 through 9 of the current and next 9 lines. This lets you target replacements to specific column positions within lines."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to delete characters using the replace command", "input": "Examples using r command for deletion: r/^^^// replaces the first 3 characters (wildcards or ^) of the current line with null, deleting the first three characters. ru/^// replaces all characters on the current attribute with null, leaving the current attribute intact but empty.", "output": "Use the r command with an empty replacement string to delete text. 'r/^^^//' deletes the first 3 characters of the current line (where ^ represents any character). 'ru/^//' deletes all characters on the current line, leaving it empty but intact. The format is '/old.string//' where the empty space after the last slash means delete the found text."}
{"instruction": "How do I toggle the display of line numbers?", "input": "The s command toggles the display of Editor line numbers in normal Editor mode, and suppresses the display of object code when the assembly formatter is on. Example: s 014 print customer-ID. s suppress on. l3 print customer.name print customer.address print customer.city. s suppress off. l2 018 print customer.state 019 print customer.zip", "output": "Type 's' to toggle line number display on and off. When line numbers are suppressed, you'll see just the code without the line numbers (like 'print customer.name' instead of '014 print customer.name'). Type 's' again to turn line numbers back on. This command also suppresses object code display when the assembly formatter is active."}
{"instruction": "Is there a way to check how much space my item is using?", "input": "The s? command displays the size of the current item in bytes. Example: s? Items size is 3187 bytes", "output": "Yes, use the s? command to display the current item's size in bytes. When you type 's?', it will show something like 'Items size is 3187 bytes', telling you exactly how much storage space the current item is consuming."}
{"instruction": "How do I set up custom tab stops for formatting?", "input": "The tb command defines tab stops for use by subsequent uses of the TAB key. Pressing Tab embeds a specific number of spaces in the current item. Each argument is separated by a space. The maximum is 16 tab stops. Example: tb 3 6 9 12 15 18 21. Pressing Tab (or Ctrl+I) while in Insert mode positions the cursor to the next defined tab stop.", "output": "Use the tb command followed by space-separated column positions to define tab stops. For example, 'tb 3 6 9 12 15 18 21' sets tab stops at columns 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21. You can define up to 16 tab stops. When in Insert mode, pressing Tab (or Ctrl+I) will move the cursor to the next defined tab stop position."}
{"instruction": "How can I move up multiple lines from my current position?", "input": "The u command moves the line pointer up a specific number of lines from the current position. The u command, followed by pressing Enter, re-displays the current line. Syntax: u number.lines. Example: 014 print customer-ID. u3 011 '' begin main logic", "output": "Use the u command followed by the number of lines to move up. For example, 'u3' moves the line pointer up 3 lines from the current position. If you type 'u' and then press Enter, it will redisplay the current line. In the example, starting at line 014, 'u3' moves up to line 011."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I use the t command?", "input": "The t command positions the line pointer to the beginning (top) of the item, without filing the data. The f command also positions to the top of the item. Any lines inserted at the top of the program are placed before line 1 of the item. Example: t 014 print customer-ID. t top.", "output": "The t command moves the line pointer to the top (beginning) of the current item without saving the data. This is similar to the f command which also goes to the top but files the data first. When you insert lines at the top of an item after using t, they will be placed before the original line 1. The example shows moving from line 014 back to the top of the item."}
{"instruction": "How do I set the number of lines displayed by the default prestored command?", "input": "The sl command sets the number of lines, rather than attributes, to display by the default p (prestored) command, p0 (zero). Syntax: sl {number.lines}. Example: Sets the display to 22 lines: sl 22", "output": "Use the sl command to set how many lines the default prestored command p0 will display. For example, 'sl 22' configures the default prestored command to display 22 lines instead of the default number. This affects the p0 command's behavior for line-based rather than attribute-based display."}
{"instruction": "How do I limit the display to only show specific columns in the editor?", "input": "Syntax: z {start.col-end.col}\n\nDescription: The z command defines zone display limits. The zone display is limited to only the data between the specified beginning and ending column ranges. If both parameters are omitted, the zone function is reset to display the entire line.\n\nParameters: start.col - Specifies the beginning column range. end.col - Specifies the ending column range.", "output": "Use the z command with column range parameters. For example, 'z 3-8' will limit the display to show only columns 3 through 8. The syntax is 'z {start.col-end.col}' where start.col specifies the beginning column and end.col specifies the ending column range."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I use the z command without any parameters?", "input": "Syntax: z {start.col-end.col}\n\nDescription: The z command defines zone display limits. The zone display is limited to only the data between the specified beginning and ending column ranges.

This cancels any previously established zone limits and returns the display to show all columns."}
{"instruction": "Show me a practical example of establishing and canceling zone limits.", "input": "Example: 014 print customer-ID.z 3-8 (Establishes zone limits) .14 (Go to line14and display) 014 int cu.z (Cancels zone limits) .14 (Go to line14and display) 014 print customer-ID", "output": "Here's a practical example:\n1. '014 print customer-ID.z 3-8' - Establishes zone limits to columns 3-8\n2. '.14' - Go to line 14 and display (shows only columns 3-8)\n3. '014 int cu.z' - Cancels zone limits (no column range specified)\n4. '.14' - Go to line 14 and display (now shows entire line)\n5. '014 print customer-ID' - Full line is displayed"}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to format and print database data directly into documents using the Output processor?", "input": "Description: The Output processor formats and prints text from commands embedded in the textual data. Utilizing the Output processor capabilities, data can be extracted directly from files within the database, formatted, and incorporated in the text of a document without special manipulation.\n\nSyntax: op file.reference {item.list} {(options)}", "output": "Yes, the Output processor can extract data directly from database files, format it, and incorporate it into document text without special manipulation. You use the syntax 'op file.reference {item.list} {(options)}' where file.reference specifies the source file and options control the formatting and output behavior."}
{"instruction": "What advanced formatting capabilities does the Output processor support?", "input": "Other capabilities supported by the Output processor include: Proportional spacing (both horizontal and vertical), Text formatting, Font control, Automatic index and table of contents generation, Boldfacing, Underlining, Headings and footings, Automatic numbering of chapters, sections, figures, and tables", "output": "The Output processor supports extensive formatting capabilities including: proportional spacing (horizontal and vertical), text formatting, font control, automatic index and table of contents generation, boldfacing, underlining, headings and footings, and automatic numbering of chapters, sections, figures, and tables."}
{"instruction": "How does the Output processor handle measurement units for horizontal spacing?", "input": "Throughout this document, the values for all commands that measure horizontal space are specified in tenths of an inch; therefore, when a command is described as inserting n spaces, it is actually inserting n/10 inches. For example, if the command .lm 10 is entered to set the margin 10 spaces, the margin is being set to 10/10 of an inch or 1 inch.", "output": "The Output processor measures horizontal space in tenths of an inch. When a command specifies 'n spaces', it actually inserts n/10 inches. For example, '.lm 10' sets a margin of 10/10 inches, which equals 1 inch."}
{"instruction": "When would I use the asterisk command in my document?", "input": "Syntax: * {text}\n\nDescription: The * command treats the entire line following the asterisk as a remark. Any text following the command is ignored by the Output processor.\n\nExample: .*This is comment text.", "output": "Use the asterisk (*) command to add comments or remarks to your document that won't appear in the output. The entire line following the asterisk is treated as a comment and ignored by the Output processor. For example, '.*This is comment text.' adds a comment that won't be processed."}
{"instruction": "How do I create appendices with automatic lettering and table of contents entries?", "input": "Syntax: .appendix title\n\nDescription: The .appendix command alphabetically assigns letters to appendix titles and creates entries in the table of contents.\n\nExample: Prints two appendixes and a table of contents. .appendix ASCII codes .appendix Device Types .ptoc", "output": "Use the .appendix command followed by the title. The command automatically assigns letters alphabetically (A, B, C, etc.) and creates table of contents entries. For example:\n.appendix ASCII codes\n.appendix Device Types\n.ptoc\nThis creates 'Appendix A: ASCII codes' and 'Appendix B: Device Types' with entries in the table of contents."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between .begin page and a regular page break?", "input": "Syntax: .begin page\n\nDescription: The .begin page command forces a page break. A page break terminates the current page, prints the optional footing, ejects a page, increments the page counter, and prints the optional heading.

{"instruction": "When should I use the .boldface command versus other text formatting options?", "input": "Syntax: .boldface\n\nDescription: The .boldface command prints text in boldface until an .xboldface command is encountered. If the printer does not have a boldface font, the text is double struck. On terminals boldfaced text is often displayed as reverse-video.", "output": "Use .boldface when you want to emphasize text with bold formatting. The command affects all text until you use .xboldface to turn it off. If your printer lacks boldface capability, text will be double-struck instead. On terminals, boldface often appears as reverse-video (inverted colors)."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to create multiple boxes on the same line?", "input": "Syntax: .box {(pos1,pos2{(,pos3,pos4)})}\n\nDescription: If position 3 and position 4 are specified, a second box is drawn from column position 3 to column position 4 (position 3 must be greater than position 1, and position 4 must be greater than position 2).\n\nExample: The words Example A and Example B are enclosed in boxes. .box 6,16,43,53 Note: Example A is shown on page n2 and Example B is shown on page n3. .xbox", "output": "Yes, you can create multiple boxes on the same line by specifying four position parameters. Use '.box pos1,pos2,pos3,pos4' where pos3 and pos4 define the second box. Position 3 must be greater than position 1, and position 4 must be greater than position 2. For example, '.box 6,16,43,53' creates two boxes: one from columns 6-16 and another from columns 43-53."}

{"instruction": "Under what conditions does the .cap sentences command capitalize text?", "input": "Description: The .cap sentences command capitalizes the first letter of each sentence or attribute. The beginning of a sentence is considered to be the first letter of each attribute. The first letter after a period, question mark, or exclamation point is also considered the beginning of a sentence, and is therefore capitalized.\n\nExample: .cap sentences this is the first sentence. this is the second. and, this is the third. Produces: This is the first sentence. This is the second. And, this is the third.", "output": "The .cap sentences command capitalizes: 1) The first letter of each attribute, 2) The first letter after a period, question mark, or exclamation point. It treats these as sentence beginnings. If text is already capitalized, it remains unchanged. The command stays active until .xcap sentences is used."}
{"instruction": "How does the .center command differ from .block center for text alignment?", "input": "Syntax: .center\n\nDescription: The .center command centers the single line of text that follows the command, can be anywhere in the text, and does not need to be turned off. This command also causes a break (new paragraph) to occur.\n\nExample: .center Heading A produces: Heading A", "output": "The .center command centers only the single line that immediately follows it, automatically causes a paragraph break, and doesn't need to be turned off. In contrast, .block center affects multiple lines until turned off with .xblock center. Use .center for single-line centering, .block center for multiple lines."}
{"instruction": "When would I use the .chain command for document processing?", "input": "Description: The .chain command passes control to a specified item-ID in the same (current) file or in a different (file reference) file. This command proves particularly useful for generating form letters. It is possible to insert the name and address of each recipient of the letter from a separate file.\n\nSyntax: .chain {dict} {file.reference} item-ID", "output": "Use .chain for generating form letters or when you need to transfer control between document sections. It's particularly useful for mail merge operations where you can insert recipient data from separate files and then chain back to process the next letter. The command passes control to a specified item-ID in the same or different file."}
{"instruction": "How do I start a new chapter with automatic numbering?", "input": "Syntax: .chapter {text}\n\nDescription: The .chapter command starts a new chapter. Chapters start on new pages and the chapter counter is incremented. The literal, Chapter, followed by the optional text, is printed centered between the current margins. The chapter, page number, and text are accumulated for the table of contents.\n\nExample: .chapter Update processor .chapter Output processor produces: Chapter 1 Update processor (page eject) Chapter 2 Output processor", "output": "Use .chapter followed by optional text. The command automatically: starts a new page, increments the chapter counter, prints 'Chapter [number]' centered with your text, and adds the entry to the table of contents. For example, '.chapter Update processor' creates 'Chapter 1 Update processor' on a new page."}
{"instruction": "How can I send raw printer control sequences without translation?", "input": "Syntax: .char {delimiter} character{s}{delimiter}\n\nDescription: The .char command sends a raw string of characters to the printer or terminal without translation. Since neither a carriage return nor a line feed (CR/LF) is printed, the .char command can be included in a sentence as a separate attribute without breaking the paragraph.", "output": "Use the .char command with delimiters around your raw character string. The command sends characters directly to the printer without translation and doesn't add CR/LF, so it can be embedded inline without breaking paragraphs. For non-printable characters, use CTRL+V followed by the decimal representation (e.g., CTRL+V 27 for ESC)."}
{"instruction": "What's the relationship between .col and .columns set commands?", "input": "Description: The .col command uses the column headings and spacing specified with the last .columns set or .variable columns command to determine the position of the specified column number. If the column number is less than the previous column number, the columns are printed and a new paragraph begins.\n\nExample: .columns set Name,10,5;Phone,10,1 .col1 Fred .col2 555-1212 .col1 Bart .col2 555-2121", "output": "The .col command relies on column definitions from .columns set. First define columns with '.columns set heading,width,space', then use '.col1', '.col2', etc. to place data. When you use a lower column number than the previous one, it prints the current row and starts a new one. Maximum of seven columns are available."}
{"instruction": "How do I set up column headers with specific widths and spacing?", "input": "Syntax: .columns {set} heading1,width1,space1;heading2,width2,space2{;...};heading7,width7,space7\n\nDescription: The .columns set command specifies the column heading, column width, and column spacing. The columns are turned off by using the Output processor .xcolumns command. The headings can contain Output processor commands and are output at the start of the columns and at the top of each subsequent page until columns are turned off.", "output": "Use '.columns set' followed by semicolon-separated column definitions. Each column is defined as 'heading,width,spacing'. For example: '.columns set Name,10,5;Phone,10,1' creates a Name column (width 10, spacing 5) and Phone column (width 10, spacing 1). Headers appear at the start and top of each page until .xcolumns turns them off."}
{"instruction": "How can I force output to display on the terminal even when using the p option at TCL?", "input": "Syntax: .crt\nThe .crt command directs the output from the Output processor to the terminal, overriding the p option specified at TCL.", "output": "Use the .crt command to direct output from the Output processor to the terminal, overriding the p option specified at TCL. The syntax is simply .crt followed by your text."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I use .crt before my text output?", "input": "Syntax: .crt\nThe .crt command directs the output from the Output processor to the terminal, overriding the p option specified at TCL. Example: .crt This message prints on the terminal. Even if the text was output using the p option, the text following the .crt command is output to the screen.", "output": "The .crt command forces the text following it to be output directly to the screen/terminal, even if you're using the p option that would normally redirect output elsewhere. For example, '.crt This message prints on the terminal.' will display the message on the terminal regardless of your TCL p option setting."}
{"instruction": "Is there a way to override TCL output redirection for specific messages?", "input": "Syntax: .crt\nThe .crt command directs the output from the Output processor to the terminal, overriding the p option specified at TCL.", "output": "Yes, you can use the .crt command to override TCL output redirection.

{"instruction": "How do I set up a hanging tab for consistent list formatting?", "input": "Syntax: .hanging tab {number}\nThe .hanging tab command sets a tab stop at the column in the text where it is entered. A number parameter may be entered with the .hanging tab command to set the hanging tab.", "output": "Use the .hanging tab command to create consistent list formatting. You can either place it at the desired column position in your text, or specify a column number with .hanging tab {number}. This sets a tab stop that subsequent text can align to."}
{"instruction": "What happens to text wrapping when I use hanging tabs?", "input": "If there are X number of spaces specified prior to the .hanging tab command, text is printed that X number of spaces plus one from the left margin. Any text that wraps is also printed that X number of spaces plus one from the left margin.", "output": "When using hanging tabs, if you have X spaces before the .hanging tab command, text prints X+1 spaces from the left margin. Importantly, any wrapped text also maintains this same indentation (X+1 spaces from the left margin), creating a consistent hanging indent effect."}
{"instruction": "Can you show me the difference between positioning .gohanging tab before and after the text?", "input": "Example 1: .hanging tab 10\nNow .gohangingtab is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.\nProduces: Now          is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.\n\nExample 2: .hanging tab 10\n.gohangingtab Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.\nProduces: Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.", "output": "The positioning of .gohanging tab affects the output differently:\n- When placed after 'Now' (.gohangingtab), it creates spacing between 'Now' and the rest of the text\n- When placed at the beginning of the line (.gohangingtab Now), it moves the entire text block to the hanging tab position\nThe first creates a gap, while the second creates a standard hanging indent."}
{"instruction": "How can I reset the margin when working with hanging tabs?", "input": "To reset the margin, place a .hanging tab at the appropriate column position. A number parameter may be entered with the .hanging tab command to set the hanging tab.", "output": "To reset the margin, simply place a new .hanging tab command at the desired column position. You can position it manually in your text or use the number parameter to specify the exact column where you want the new margin set."}
{"instruction": "How can I add a highlight character to the right margin of my text?", "input": "Syntax: .hilite character\nThe .hilite command prints a single character on the right margin and is in effect until an .xhilite command is issued.", "output": "Use the .hilite command followed by a character to print that character on the right margin. For example, .hilite * will print an asterisk on the right margin. The highlighting remains active until you issue an .xhilite command to turn it off."}
{"instruction": "What characters can I use with the .hilite command?", "input": "The .hilite command prints a single character on the right margin. Any character, other than a period, can be specified as the highlight character.", "output": "You can use any single character except a period (.) as the highlight character with the .hilite command. This gives you flexibility to use symbols like *, #, |, or any other character for margin highlighting."}
{"instruction": "How long does the highlight effect last once I enable it?", "input": "The .hilite command prints a single character on the right margin and is in effect until an .xhilite command is issued.", "output": "The highlight effect remains active indefinitely once enabled with .hilite, continuing to print the specified character on the right margin until you explicitly disable it with an .xhilite command."}
{"instruction": "Can you show me how to highlight text with an asterisk in the margin?", "input": "Example: Produces an * character on the right margin. .hilite *", "output": "To highlight text with an asterisk in the right margin, use: .hilite *\nThis will place an asterisk (*) character on the right margin and continue doing so for subsequent text until you use .xhilite to turn it off."}
{"instruction": "How do I indent just the next paragraph without affecting the overall margin?", "input": "Syntax: .indent {-}number.spaces\nThe .indent command indents the text following the command a specified number spaces from the left margin.", "output": "Use the .indent command with the number of spaces you want to indent. For example, .indent 10 will indent the following text 10 spaces from the left margin. This is a one-time indentation that doesn't change the overall margin setting."}
{"instruction": "What happens if I use a negative number with .indent?", "input": "If negative, the line begins to the left of the previously set left margin.", "output": "When you use a negative number with .indent (like .indent -5), the text will begin to the left of the previously set left margin, effectively creating a hanging or outdented effect."}
{"instruction": "Can you demonstrate the difference between .indent and normal text positioning?", "input": "Example: .indent 10\nThis line indents 10 characters from the left margin.\nThis line will print on the left margin.\nProduces: This line begins 10 characters from the left margin.\nThis line will print on the left margin.", "output": "The .indent command affects only the immediately following text. In the example, the first line after .indent 10 is indented 10 spaces, but the second line returns to the normal left margin position. This shows that .indent is a one-time effect, not a permanent margin change."}
{"instruction": "What's the default indentation if I don't specify a number with .indent?", "input": "Specifies the number of spaces to indent. If not specified, the default is 1.", "output": "If you don't specify a number with the .indent command, the default indentation is 1 space from the left margin."}
{"instruction": "How is .indent margin different from the regular .indent command?", "input": "Syntax: .indent margin {-}number.spaces\nThe .indent margin command adjusts the left margin a specified number of spaces. The command stays in effect until the margin is changed.", "output": "Unlike .indent which affects only the next paragraph, .indent margin permanently adjusts the left margin by the specified number of spaces and stays in effect until you change the margin again. It's a persistent margin adjustment rather than a one-time indentation."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I use .indent margin in the middle of text?", "input": "If the command is in the middle of an attribute, the preceding text is output and the next word begins a new paragraph that is indented number of spaces.", "output": "When .indent margin appears in the middle of text, it outputs all the preceding text first, then starts a new paragraph with the adjusted margin. The margin change takes effect immediately and continues for all subsequent text."}
{"instruction": "Can I move the left margin further left using .indent margin?", "input": "If negative, the left margin moves farther to the left. If not specified, the default is 1.", "output": "Yes, you can use a negative number with .indent margin to move the left margin further to the left. For example, .indent margin -3 would move the margin 3 spaces to the left. If you don't specify a number, the default adjustment is 1 space."}
{"instruction": "How would I demonstrate the persistent effect of .indent margin?", "input": "Example: .nofill\n.indent 10\ntest\n.indent -5\nline five", "output": "This example shows .indent margin's persistent effect: .nofill disables text filling, .indent 10 moves the margin right by 10 spaces (affecting 'test'), then .indent -5 moves it back left by 5 spaces (affecting 'line five'). Each margin change remains active until the next margin command."}
{"instruction": "How do I create index entries that will appear with page numbers?", "input": "Syntax: .index 'phrase'\n.index: 'main.heading' 'phrase' {'phrase'...}\nThe .index command inserts a phrase and the current page number into the index.", "output": "Use the .index command to create index entries. For simple entries, use .index 'phrase' which adds the phrase with the current page number. For hierarchical entries, use .index: 'main.heading' 'phrase' to create main headings with subentries."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between .index and .index: with a colon?", "input": "The .index command inserts a phrase and the current page number into the index. A subheading is specified by appending a colon to the .index command.", "output": "The colon in .index: creates hierarchical index entries. .index 'phrase' creates a simple entry, while .index: 'main.heading' 'phrase' creates a main heading with subentries underneath it in the index."}
{"instruction": "Can you show me how to create both simple and hierarchical index entries?", "input": "Examples: .index 'Schedule'\nProduces: Schedule . . . 13\n\n.index: 'Schedule' 'production'\nProduces: Schedule\nproduction . . . 13", "output": "Here are examples of both types:\n- Simple entry: .index 'Schedule' produces 'Schedule . . . 13'\n- Hierarchical entry: .index: 'Schedule' 'production' produces a main 'Schedule' heading with 'production . . . 13' as a subentry underneath"}
{"instruction": "How do I handle index entries that span multiple words?", "input": "If the main heading or phrase consists of multiple words, the words must be enclosed in quotation marks.", "output": "When your index phrase contains multiple words, you must enclose the entire phrase in quotation marks. For example, use .index 'Project Management' rather than .index Project Management."}
{"instruction": "What commands let me save and print the index I've created?", "input": "Note: The index can be saved in an item with the .save index command, and can be printed with the .print index command.", "output": "After creating index entries, you can save the index using the .save index command to store it in an item, and print it using the .print index command to output the formatted index."}
{"instruction": "How can I customize the header that appears on index pages?", "input": "Syntax: .index heading text\nThe .index heading command substitutes the heading text as the header for index pages. The heading text is output on the top of each index page.", "output": "Use the .index heading command followed by your desired text to customize the header that appears at the top of index pages.

When the index is printed, it shows:\nTopics covered\nTopic 1,1\nTopic 2,1\nTopic 3,1\nTopic 4,1\nThe custom heading appears at the top, followed by the alphabetized index entries with page numbers."}
{"instruction": "How can I pause processing to accept user input during output?", "input": "Syntax: .input\nThe .input command accepts and processes text input from the terminal.", "output": "Use the .input command to pause processing and accept text input from the terminal. The Output processor will pause at that point, prompt the user for input, then resume processing by inserting the entered data in place of the .input statement."}
{"instruction": "What happens when the Output processor encounters .input?", "input": "The Output processor pauses, prompts the user, and resumes processing inserting the data in lieu of the .input statement.", "output": "When the Output processor encounters .input, it pauses execution, displays a prompt to the user, waits for them to enter text, then continues processing by replacing the .input command with whatever the user typed."}
{"instruction": "Can you show me a practical example of using .input in a document?", "input": "Example: Dear .input,\nPlease find attached...", "output": "Here's a practical example: 'Dear .input,\\nPlease find attached...'\nWhen processed, this would pause at the .input command, prompt the user to enter a name, then continue with 'Dear [entered name],\\nPlease find attached...' creating a personalized document."}
{"instruction": "How do I enable italic formatting for my text output?", "input": "Syntax: .italics\nThe .italics command causes the text following the command to be output in italics. The italics mode is terminated with an .x or an .xitalics command.", "output": "Use the .italics command to enable italic formatting for subsequent text. The text following this command will be output in italics until you terminate the italic mode with either .x or .xitalics command."}
{"instruction": "What should I do if my printer doesn't support italics?", "input": "The .italics command causes the text following the command to be output in italics. If the printer does not support italics, this command has no affect.", "output": "If your printer doesn't support italics, the .italics command will have no effect and the text will print normally. The command won't cause errors, but no italic formatting will be applied to the output."}
{"instruction": "Can you demonstrate how to italicize a single word in a sentence?", "input": "Example: The word example is printed in italics.\nIn this example, the word .it example .x is italicized.", "output": "To italicize a single word, use .italics (or .it) before the word and .x after it: 'In this example, the word .it example .x is italicized.' This turns on italics for just the word 'example' and then turns off italic formatting."}
{"instruction": "What commands can I use to turn off italic formatting?", "input": "The italics mode is terminated with an .x or an .xitalics command.", "output": "You can turn off italic formatting using either the .x command (which turns off any active formatting) or the specific .xitalics command.

{"instruction": "What's the difference between precision and scalefactor in the m processing code?", "input": "The m processing code is a masking conversion used for both numeric and text string formatting. Parameters: precision indicates the number of decimal positions to print after the decimal point (0-9), defaults to 0. scalefactor indicates the power to which the value is to be descaled (0-9), no default. When precision is specified without scalefactor, scalefactor defaults to precision value (mr2 is identical to mr22). Example: an internally stored number is 56789 with four implied decimals. The mask mr4 indicates both scalefactor and precision are 4, returning 5.6789. For mr24, first scales by 4 then rounds to two decimals resulting in 5.68.", "output": "Precision determines how many decimal places to display (0-9), while scalefactor determines how many decimal places to shift the internal value (0-9). If you specify precision without scalefactor, scalefactor defaults to the precision value. For example, with internal value 56789 (4 implied decimals): mr4 shows 5.6789 (scale by 4, show 4 decimals), while mr24 shows 5.68 (scale by 4, but show only 2 decimals with rounding)."}

{"instruction": "Why should I be cautious when using mask conversions with AQL selection criteria?", "input": "The m processing code is a masking conversion used for both numeric and text string formatting. CAUTION: The functionality for mask and date conversions is not intuitive when combined with selection criteria in an AQL sentence. If a mask or date conversion exists in the output-conversion, that conversion is applied to the selection criteria in an AQL statement. For instance, in the sentence: select filename with attr \"90]\" where the data contains values as 9000, 9010, 9020, the \"90]\" is converted by an mr2 to \"9000]\". The logic is to convert the selection criteria once, rather than converting each value processed by the select command. Moving the mr2 to the correlative attribute bypasses the conversion to the selection criteria.", "output": "Be cautious because mask conversions in output-conversion attributes are applied to selection criteria in AQL statements, not just to output formatting. For example, if you have mr2 in output-conversion and search for \"90]\", it gets converted to \"9000]\" before comparison. This can cause unexpected results. To avoid this, move the mr2 to the correlative attribute instead, which bypasses the conversion of selection criteria while still formatting the output."}

For example:\n\npibs link-dev att-devs location device user udate utime account\n49 Jo Allen VT100 ja 01/17 7:11 ba\n\nThis shows port 49 is used by Jo Allen with a VT100 terminal, logged in as 'ja' on 01/17 at 7:11 in the 'ba' account."}
{"instruction": "What should each user have in the users file?", "input": "Each user should have their own unique logon item-ID in the users file. The tcl-stack item for each user uses the same item-ID as the logon item-ID in the users file.", "output": "Each user should have their own unique logon item-ID in the users file. This item-ID must be unique to ensure proper user identification and access control. Additionally, the tcl-stack item for each user uses the same item-ID as their logon item-ID, maintaining consistency across user-related system files."}
{"instruction": "How would I view and modify a user's information in the users file?", "input": "Example: :up md,users, ja\nusers 'ja' size=318\nname Jo Allen\naddress Shipping & Receiving\nzip\nphone x.449\nkeys\npassword\nprivilege sys2\noptions n\nmacro logto dm\n10 set-sym gsym\n11 brk-level\n12 bulletin.board new\n13 tcl-hdr-off", "output": "To view and modify a user's information, use the Update processor command like 'up md,users, ja' (where 'ja' is the user ID). This displays the user's record including name, address, phone, privileges, options, login macro, and other settings. You can then modify any of these fields as needed. The example shows user 'ja' (Jo Allen) with sys2 privileges and a logto dm macro."}
{"instruction": "What kind of information is stored in a user's profile?", "input": "Example: :up md,users, ja\nusers 'ja' size=318\nname Jo Allen\naddress Shipping & Receiving\nzip\nphone x.449\nkeys\npassword\nprivilege sys2\noptions n\nmacro logto dm\n10 set-sym gsym\n11 brk-level\n12 bulletin.board new\n13 tcl-hdr-off", "output": "A user's profile in the users file stores comprehensive information including: name, address, zip code, phone number, security keys, password, privilege level, user options, login macro, and various system settings like symbol definitions, break levels, bulletin board settings, and TCL header preferences. This provides complete user configuration and personalization data."}
{"instruction": "How does the var file provide access to TCL shell variables?", "input": "The var driver (most easily used via the var file in the dm account) provides access to TCL shell variables via a file interface. A read using the variable name as the item-ID returns the shell variable's contents. A write using the variable name as the item-ID is identical to running a TCL set on that variable.", "output": "The var file provides access to TCL shell variables through a standard file interface. You can read a variable's contents by using the variable name as the item-ID, write to a variable (equivalent to running 'TCL set'), and delete variables (equivalent to 'TCL unset'). This allows you to manipulate shell variables using normal file operations instead of TCL commands."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to execute TCL commands through the var file interface?", "input": "A read using a TCL command surrounded by back-quotes executes the TCL command and returns the results as if those results had been stored in an item.", "output": "Yes, you can execute TCL commands through the var file interface by surrounding the command with back-quotes when reading. For example, reading from an item-ID like `'who'` executes the 'who' TCL command and returns the results as if they had been stored in an item. This provides a way to execute and capture TCL command output through the file interface."}
{"instruction": "Show me practical examples of using the var file for variable manipulation.", "input": "Example: open \"var\"\n*\n* Read a shell variable\n*\nprint @user\n*\nread xx from \"user\"\nprint xx\n*\n*\n* Write a shell variable\n*\nexecute \"set myvar=abc\"\n*\nwrite \"abc\" on \"myvar\"\n*\n* Delete a shell variable\n*\nexecute \"unset myvar\"\n*\ndelete \"myvar\"", "output": "Here are practical examples of using the var file:\n\n* Read a shell variable:\nread xx from \"user\"\nprint xx\n\n* Write a shell variable (equivalent to 'set myvar=abc'):\nwrite \"abc\" on \"myvar\"\n\n* Delete a shell variable (equivalent to 'unset myvar'):\ndelete \"myvar\"\n\n* Execute a TCL command:\nread xx from \"'who'\"\nprint xx\n\nThese operations allow you to manipulate TCL variables using standard file operations instead of TCL commands."}
{"instruction": "How do I output text to the screen in a D3 macro without a trailing carriage return?", "input": "display statement\nSyntax: display message.text{+}\nThe display statement outputs text on the screen in a macros or a Procs. If the message text is terminated by a +, the trailing carriage return is suppressed.", "output": "To output text without a trailing carriage return in a D3 macro, use the display statement with a + at the end of your message text. For example: `display main menu@(-14)+` will display the text and suppress the trailing form feed."}
{"instruction": "What's the purpose of the prompt statement in D3 macros?", "input": "prompt statement\nSyntax: prompt {prompt.text}\nThe prompt statement in a macro prompts the user with a specified text string. The user is then given the option to either continue (by entering c, or stopping the process (by entering q). No other characters are allowed.", "output": "The prompt statement in D3 macros is used to display a text message to the user and wait for their input to either continue or quit the process. Only 'c' (continue) or 'q' (quit) responses are accepted. For example, `prompt Insert first reel` will display 'Insert first reel -- Quit/Continue (q/c)?' and wait for user input."}
{"instruction": "When would I use the (n and (p options with TCL commands?", "input": "Options (TCL)\nSyntax: tcl.commands...(n tcl.commands...(p\nThe print (p and no pause (n options are the only standard options available to every TCL command. Options always display at the end of a TCL command and must be preceded by a left parenthesis.", "output": "Use the (n option to activate the no pause function on output to the terminal, preventing the system from pausing for user input during long outputs. Use the (p option to direct output to the system printer via the spooler. For example: `copy dm,bp, term-type (p` sends output to printer, while `block-print this is a test (n` prevents pausing during output."}
{"instruction": "How can I create conditional logic in D3 procedures?", "input": "Branching\nSyntax: if {\"|’}string1{\"|’} [<|l|=|e|>|g] {\"|’}string2{\"|’} then go label\nFor conditional branching, the if-then-go construct is used. The if statement is a conditional branch statement in a paragraph or PROC.", "output": "Use the if-then-go construct for conditional branching in D3 procedures. You can compare strings or prompt for user input and branch based on the result. For example: `if <<Input a number between 1 and 10:>> > 5 then go greater` will prompt the user for input and branch to the 'greater' label if the input is greater than 5."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to use shell variables in D3 commands, and how?", "input": "@ shell variable\nSyntax: @[{}]variable.name[}]|@[{]$variable.name[}] @'tcl.command'\nThe @ character indicates a D3 shell variable.", "output": "Yes, you can use shell variables in D3 commands by prefixing them with the @ character. Use @variable.name for simple variables or @$variable.name for referenced variables. For example, after setting `myfile=\"dm,bp,\"`, you can use `select @$myfile sampling 5` to select from that file. You can also execute TCL commands as variables using @'tcl.command' syntax."}
{"instruction": "What information does the abs.fid command display?", "input": "abs.fid command\nSyntax: abs.fid {file.reference}\nThe abs.fid command displays the ABS information. The ABS base FID, release date, implementation, and release title display.", "output": "The abs.fid command displays ABS (Absolute) file information including the filename, FID, size, usage, date, implementation, level, and revision. If no file reference is specified, it uses the boot ABS dm,abs by default. The output shows details like filename, FID number, file size, usage statistics, creation date, implementation type (like RS6000), and version information."}
{"instruction": "How would I create or modify user accounts in D3?", "input": "account-maint command\nSyntax: account-maint\nThe account-maint command invokes a menu to create, modify, or delete user accounts. The account definition item, located in the mds file, can also be updated or deleted using the Update processor. This requires a sys2 privilege level.", "output": "Use the account-maint command to create, modify, or delete user accounts through an interactive menu. This command requires sys2 privilege level. The menu allows you to update account name, synonym account/modulo, privilege level, password, accounting update settings, and lock codes. You can also use the Update processor directly on the mds file for account management."}
{"instruction": "Under what conditions should I use different options with account-restore?", "input": "account-restore command\nSyntax: account-restore account.name{(options)}\nThe account-restore BASIC program restores an account from an account-save, file-save, or md-save magnetic media or pseudo tape.

{"instruction": "What's the difference between a regular account-save and using the incremental options?", "input": "account-save command\nSyntax: account-save {account.name} {account.name...} {(options)}\nOptions include: l=save only listed item-IDs, m=same as l but clears dirty bits, r=same as l and m but saves list with file. The l option saves only the list of item-IDs provided in the associated item for the given file, located in the dm,file of files, file, beginning at attribute 25.", "output": "A regular account-save backs up entire accounts, while incremental options (l, m, r) save only specific items. The (l) option saves only item-IDs listed in the dm,file of files file starting at attribute 25, but doesn't clear dirty bits so items remain marked for future incremental saves. The (m) option does the same but clears dirty bits. The (r) option additionally saves the item list as a separate item in the file of files. These incremental options are useful for selective backups of changed data."}
{"instruction": "How do I add two hexadecimal numbers in D3?", "input": "addx command\nSyntax: addx hex.number hex.number\nThe addx command adds two hexadecimal numbers and displays the result as a hexadecimal number.", "output": "Use the addx command followed by two hexadecimal numbers to add them together. For example: `addx 1F 3352` will add the hexadecimal numbers 1F and 3352 and display the result as a hexadecimal number."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to schedule tasks to run at specific times in D3?", "input": "alarm command\nSyntax: alarm {delay|hh:mm{:ss}{,date|*}{command}}{(options}\nThe alarm BASIC program schedules a task at a given time, or after a given delay in seconds, at a given date. Options: c=cancel all alarms, l=list current alarms, s=set current alarms.", "output": "Yes, you can schedule tasks using the alarm command. You can specify either a delay in seconds or a specific time (hh:mm:ss format). Use an asterisk (*) for the date to run daily. For example: `alarm 18:00 * file save is starting` displays a message daily at 6 PM, or `alarm 120 off` logs off after 120 seconds. Note that the alarm signal handler must be set with 'trap alrm useralarm' before using alarms."}
{"instruction": "What does the archive-accounts command do and when should I use it?", "input": "archive-accounts command\nSyntax: archive-accounts {<purge_date>} {(d}\nThe archive-accounts command moves entries from the accounts data level to an archive data level, or optionally deletes them. The (d) option specifies that entries will be deleted instead of archived.", "output": "The archive-accounts command manages the accounts file by moving old entries to an archive level or deleting them. It moves all entries created on or before the specified purge_date to dm,accounts,<internal date>. If no date is provided, it defaults to the current date. Use the (d) option to delete entries instead of archiving them. This helps maintain system performance by managing historical account data while preserving audit trails."}
{"instruction": "How would I assign a printer to a spooler form queue on UNIX systems?", "input": "assignfq (UNIX) command\nSyntax: assignfq form.queue{-n},device.name{(unix.command)} {,form.queue,device.name{(unix.command)} {...}} {(options}\nThe assignfq command assigns a printer device driver to a spooler form queue. On UNIX-based implementations, the spooler can transfer data directly to a UNIX-based operation by placing the UNIX command string in parentheses after the device name.", "output": "Use the assignfq command with the form queue number and device name. For direct UNIX output, place the UNIX command in parentheses after the device name. For example: `assignfq 3,hp-lzrii(cat>/file1)` assigns form queue 3 to use the hp-lzrii driver and pipe output to the UNIX command 'cat>/file1'. After assignment, use `sp-assign f3` to activate the assignment for your process."}
{"instruction": "Under what circumstances would I use the auto-disconnect feature?", "input": "auto-disconnect command\nSyntax: auto-disconnect [(n[-m])] {delay time} {(C}\nThe auto-disconnect command allows certain clients the capability to disconnect from the server with a custom delay, reserving the line for reconnect. The delay allows clients to reserve their connection while logged off, releasing the license for other users.", "output": "Use auto-disconnect when you need to manage license usage efficiently in environments where users frequently disconnect and reconnect. It allows a client to disconnect while reserving their line for a specified delay period (up to 32,767 minutes), releasing the license for other users. This is useful for mobile users, temporary disconnections, or environments with more users than licenses. For example: `auto-disconnect 1 10` reserves line 1 for 10 minutes after disconnect."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between auto-logoff and auto-disconnect?", "input": "auto-logoff command\nSyntax: auto-logoff target [seconds] [(options)]\nThe auto-logoff command automatically logs off a specified process after either a designated period of inactivity or the loss of an incoming DTR signal. Options: C=turn off auto-logoff, D=monitor DTR signal, U=set timeouts by user name.", "output": "Auto-logoff automatically logs off processes after CPU inactivity or DTR signal loss, while auto-disconnect reserves the line after disconnect. Auto-logoff monitors active processes and logs them off based on inactivity (measured in seconds) or modem disconnection. For example: `auto-logoff 9 600` logs off process 9 after 10 minutes of inactivity, while `auto-logoff 1 (D)` logs off line 1 if it becomes disconnected. Auto-logoff is for managing active sessions, while auto-disconnect manages reconnection privileges."}
{"instruction": "How can I set up a command to execute automatically when a process tries to go to TCL?", "input": "auto-restart command\nSyntax: AUTO-RESTART [ UPDATE.USER | [n[-m]] | PERMANENT ] { command | CLEAR }\nThe auto-restart command allows the user to specify or clear a command that is executed whenever a D3 process is attempting to go to TCL. Unless the n option is specified, changes take effect on the next log on.", "output": "Use the auto-restart command to specify a command that executes when a process attempts to go to TCL prompt. For example: `AUTO-RESTART 1 TCLPROC` sets process 1 to execute the TCLPROC command instead of showing the TCL prompt. Use `UPDATE.USER` to write settings to the USERS file, `PERMANENT` to write to the SECURITY-CONTROL file, or specify line numbers for immediate effect. Use `CLEAR` to remove auto-restart settings. This is useful for creating custom shells or restricting direct TCL access."}
{"instruction": "How would I compile a BASIC program with case sensitivity enabled?", "input": "Syntax: basic file.reference itemlist* {(options)}\n\nThe basic BASIC program invokes the BASIC and/or FlashBASIC compiler, which translates the specified source code into executable object code with case-sensitivity in effect. This causes the compiler to only accept uppercase keywords.", "output": "Use the basic command followed by the file reference and program name. The basic command automatically enables case-sensitivity, requiring all keywords to be in uppercase. For example: 'basic bp testprog' compiles the program testprog in the bp file with case sensitivity in effect."}
{"instruction": "What compilation options are available when using the basic command for optimization?", "input": "Parameter(s): o - Produces FlashBASIC optimized code. Note: If any module in a program is compiled with the o option, than all modules in that program must also have been compiled with the o option. w - Optimizes without source when used with the o option. This allows optimizing programs without source code.", "output": "The basic command offers two optimization options: 'o' produces FlashBASIC optimized code, and 'w' optimizes without source when used with the 'o' option. Important note: if any module in a program uses the 'o' option, all modules in that program must be compiled with the 'o' option for consistency."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to suppress error messages and only see compilation errors during BASIC compilation?", "input": "Parameter(s): e - Lists only error lines encountered during the compilation of the program. The listing indicates line number in the source code item, the source line itself, and a description of the error associated with the line.", "output": "Yes, use the 'e' option with the basic command. This option lists only error lines encountered during compilation, showing the line number in the source code, the source line itself, and a description of the associated error, filtering out other compilation output."}
{"instruction": "When should I use the 'c' option during BASIC compilation?", "input": "Parameter(s): c - Compresses the object by suppressing the end-of-line (EOL) opcodes from the object code item. This option is designed to be used with debugged and cataloged programs. Because the EOL opcodes are used to count lines for error messages, any run-time error message in a program compiled with the c option indicates the error is on line 0. Additionally, the c option removes the ability to single-step with the BASIC debugger.", "output": "Use the 'c' option only with debugged and cataloged programs when you want to compress the object code. This option suppresses end-of-line opcodes, reducing code size, but it eliminates debugging capabilities - runtime errors will show as line 0 and single-stepping with the BASIC debugger becomes impossible."}
{"instruction": "How can I configure the I/O blocking factor for better sequential file access performance?", "input": "Syntax: blkio {[factor|off]} {(options)}\n\nThe blkio BASIC program displays or sets the I/O blocking factor, or number of frames read in one disk access during sequential file accesses. The setting is global for the whole system, and can be changed at any time.", "output": "Use the blkio command with a numeric factor to set how many frames are read in one disk access. For example, 'blkio 4' sets the blocking factor to 4 frames. Use 'blkio off' or 'blkio 1' to disable grouping. The maximum is 64 frames. Without arguments, it displays the current setting."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between having I/O blocking enabled versus disabled?", "input": "If the mechanism is active, this message displays: 'IO blocking factor set to n frames.' This indicates that sequential access reads n frames at each disk access. If the mechanism is disabled, this message displays: 'IO blocking disabled.' This indicates that the I/O blocking mechanism is not active, and that frames are read one at a time.", "output": "When I/O blocking is enabled, the system reads multiple frames (n frames) in a single disk access during sequential operations like save or AQL processing, improving efficiency. When disabled, frames are read one at a time, which may be slower but uses less memory per operation."}
{"instruction": "Is there a way to set the blocking factor without seeing confirmation messages?", "input": "Parameter(s): q - Quiet option does not display anything while setting the blocking factor. Example: blkio 4 (q - Sets the blocking factor to four frames, and suppresses the message.", "output": "Yes, use the 'q' option to suppress output messages. For example, 'blkio 4 (q' sets the blocking factor to 4 frames without displaying any confirmation message."}
{"instruction": "How would I create a banner with specific text formatting options?", "input": "Syntax: block-print text{(options)}\n\nThe block-print command produces a banner by converting characters to a large block format, made up of rows and columns of the character itself. Parameter(s): u - Uppercase option. If the banner character is lowercase, the block character is made up of the equivalent uppercase character.", "output": "Use the block-print command followed by your text. For uppercase formatting, add the 'u' option. For example, 'block-print \"Hello World\" (u' creates a banner where lowercase letters are displayed as uppercase block characters."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I include spaces and special characters in block-print text?", "input": "Text entered. If the text contains too many characters, the text string is wrapped at a word boundary, if possible; otherwise, the text is wrapped after nine characters. Text enclosed within quotation marks attempts to print on the same line without breaking on the spaces between the words.", "output": "Block-print automatically wraps long text at word boundaries when possible, or after 9 characters if no word boundary exists. Text in quotation marks forces words to stay together on the same line without breaking on spaces, useful for phrases like \"Eat At Joe's\"."}
{"instruction": "Can I send block-print output directly to a printer?", "input": "Parameter(s): p - Directs output to system printer via the spooler. Example: block-print \"Eat At Joe's\" Bar & Grill (p", "output": "Yes, use the 'p' option to send the banner output directly to the system printer via the spooler. For example, 'block-print \"Company Name\" (p' creates and prints the banner."}
{"instruction": "How do I disable the BREAK key for security purposes?", "input": "Syntax: break-key {pib.no}{(options)}\n\nParameter(s): f - Disables the BREAK key. s - Suppresses the display of the status message. Example: break-key (f - [1323] Break key disabled.", "output": "Use 'break-key (f' to disable the BREAK key. This security feature prevents users from breaking out of processes. You can also specify a PIB number to disable it for a specific process, like 'break-key 35 (f'."}
{"instruction": "What's the purpose of the break-key-off macro compared to the break-key command?", "input": "The break-key-off macro disables the BREAK key on the current port. If the PIB number is specified, the BREAK key is disabled on the requested PIB number. By default, the debugger is enabled for all processes. This security feature can be used for end-user applications.", "output": "The break-key-off macro is a simplified version that only disables the BREAK key, while break-key can both enable and disable it. Both serve the same security purpose for end-user applications where you don't want users to break into the debugger."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to check the current BREAK key status without changing it?", "input": "The break-key command toggles the availability of the BREAK key, or displays its present status when issued without options.", "output": "Yes, simply run 'break-key' without any options to display the current BREAK key status without making any changes to the setting."}
{"instruction": "How can I monitor which file frames are currently in the RAM buffer?", "input": "Syntax: buf-map {minfid-maxfid} {(options)}\n\nThe buf-map BASIC program displays a visual map of the file system, indicating which frames are currently being held in the RAM buffer area, and updates the display every few seconds.", "output": "Use the buf-map command with optional FID range parameters. For example, 'buf-map 1-1000' shows a visual grid map of frames 1 through 1000, displaying which ones are currently active in RAM buffers with numbers 0-7 indicating different buffer states."}
{"instruction": "What do the different numbers mean in the buf-map display?", "input": "The buffer displays a number between 0 through 7, which indicates the buffer's state. State table: 0 - Available, 1 - Available, 2-8 various combinations of Refer'd, Batch, and Write-req states.", "output": "Numbers 0-7 represent different buffer states: 0 and 1 are available buffers, while 2-8 represent various combinations of referenced, batch, and write-required states. The display shows these numbers in a grid format to visualize memory usage patterns."}
{"instruction": "Can I get a quick snapshot of memory usage without scanning all buffers?", "input": "Parameter(s): s - Samples about 10% of the memory, rather than reading all buffers in memory. This option provides a quick snapshot of the memory usage, but is less accurate.", "output": "Yes, use the 's' option like 'buf-map (s' to sample approximately 10% of memory instead of reading all buffers. This provides a faster but less accurate snapshot of memory usage patterns."}
{"instruction": "How would I generate a histogram of buffer usage for specific days and times?", "input": "Syntax: buffers.g counter{start.day{-end.day} {step {start.time-{end.time}}} {(options)}\n\nUsed in conjunction with the buffers BASIC program, the buffers.g command produces a graphic histogram of buffer usage for a range of dates and times.", "output": "Use buffers.g with a counter name and specify day/time ranges. For example, 'buffers.g writes monday-friday 00:30 08:00-17:30' creates a histogram of write activity for weekdays during business hours with 30-minute intervals."}
{"instruction": "What buffer statistics can I analyze with the buffers.g command?", "input": "Available attribute names include: 0-time, 1-activ (Activations), 2-idle (Idle time), 3-fflt (Frame faults), 4-writes (Disk writes), 5-bfail (Buffer search fails), 6-fqfull (Read queue full), 7-wqfull (Write queue full), 8-dskerr (Disk errors), 9-elapsd (Elapsed time), and others.", "output": "You can analyze various metrics including frame faults (fflt), disk writes (writes), activations (activ), idle time (idle), buffer search fails (bfail), queue status (fqfull, wqfull), disk errors (dskerr), and elapsed time (elapsd). Each provides insights into different aspects of system performance."}
{"instruction": "Is there a way to create smooth graph curves instead of histograms?", "input": "Parameter(s): g - Displays a graph, rather than a histogram. With this option, the step is automatically calculated. The results are averaged in an attempt to make the curve smoother.", "output": "Yes, use the 'g' option to display a smooth graph instead of a histogram. This option automatically calculates appropriate steps and averages the results to create smoother curves for better visualization of trends."}
{"instruction": "How do I set up automatic bulletin display when users log on?", "input": "The bulletin.board BASIC program prints bulletins from the bulletin file located in the dm account. This may be included in the user logon macro list to automatically execute each time the user logs on.", "output": "Add the bulletin.board command to the user logon macro list. It will automatically display bulletins from the bulletin file in the dm account each time a user logs on to the system."}
{"instruction": "Can I display only bulletins that haven't been read before?", "input": "The optional new parameter retrieves items that have not been previously read. Example: bulletin.board new", "output": "Yes, use 'bulletin.board new' to display only bulletins that haven't been previously read by the current user, filtering out already-seen content."}
{"instruction": "How would I display a calendar for a specific month and year?", "input": "Syntax: cal {{month} year}\n\nThe UNIX cal macro executes the UNIX cal command. Parameter(s): month - Month of the year, and must be a number between 1 and 12, inclusive. If a month is specified, only the calendar for the given month displays. year - Year for the calendar, in either two or four digits.", "output": "Use 'cal month year' format. For example, 'cal 2 2003' displays the calendar for February 2003. The month must be a number between 1-12, and the year can be in two or four digit format."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I run the cal command without any parameters?", "input": "Example: cal - February 2003, Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa, [calendar display follows]", "output": "Running 'cal' without parameters displays the current month's calendar in a standard format showing the month name, year, and a grid layout with days of the week and dates."}
{"instruction": "How can I enable TCL command capturing for audit purposes?", "input": "Syntax: capt {(options)}\n\nThe capt command enables or disables the capturing of every TCL command issued. When enabled, TCL commands are placed in the captcl file using the item-ID user-ID*port.number.", "output": "Use the 'capt' command to enable TCL command capturing. Commands are automatically stored in the captcl file with item-IDs formatted as user-ID*port.number for tracking and audit purposes."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between turning off capturing with and without the 'n' option?", "input": "Parameter(s): o - Turns capturing off. n - Deletes item after disabling and is only valid with the o option. Examples: capt (o - Turns off TCL command capturing. capt (on - Turns off capturing and deletes item from the captcl file.", "output": "Using 'capt (o' simply turns off capturing but preserves the captured data in the captcl file. Using 'capt (on' turns off capturing AND deletes the captured item from the captcl file, removing the audit trail."}
{"instruction": "How do I enable case-sensitive operations for my current session?", "input": "Syntax: case {(options)}\n\nThe case command toggles case-sensitivity on the current port, or displays its present condition when used without options. Parameter(s): n - Toggles on case sensitivity.", "output": "Use 'case (n' to enable case-sensitivity for your current port. This affects how the system treats uppercase and lowercase characters in comparisons and lookups. Case insensitivity is the system default."}
{"instruction": "Why would I want to add case-on to a user's logon macro?", "input": "The default is case insensitive. To remain case sensitive, add the case-on command to the user logon macro. Two macro versions of this command, case-on and case-off, are provided to direct comparisons within data files to be case-sensitive or case-insensitive.", "output": "Adding case-on to the logon macro ensures that case-sensitivity is automatically enabled each time the user logs on, maintaining consistent behavior for applications that require case-sensitive data comparisons, since the system default is case-insensitive."}
{"instruction": "What impact does case sensitivity have on AQL operations?", "input": "The type of comparisons performed on data within attributes using AQL are determined by the status of the case bit.", "output": "Case sensitivity directly affects how AQL processes data comparisons within attributes. When case-sensitive mode is active, AQL treats 'ABC' and 'abc' as different values; when case-insensitive, they're treated as the same."}
{"instruction": "How would I convert all item-IDs in a file to uppercase?", "input": "The case-file BASIC program converts the case of items to either uppercase or lowercase. This invokes the conv-case command and passes it the e, q, u, and o options. If the file reference is omitted, the process prompts for it.", "output": "Use 'case-file filename' to convert item-IDs. The program will prompt for dictionary level confirmation. Answer 'n' for data level or 'y' for dictionary level. The program automatically applies uppercase conversion with error reporting and quiet options."}
{"instruction": "What information does the cat command provide about BASIC programs?", "input": "Syntax: cat file.reference\n\nThe cat BASIC program displays information about the size and location of BASIC object code. Example shows: binary item listing for file jesbp with ptr fid and length columns for each program.", "output": "The cat command displays a listing of compiled BASIC programs showing the program name, pointer FID (frame identifier), and length for each object code item, helping you understand the storage allocation and size of your compiled programs."}
{"instruction": "How do I make a BASIC program executable from the TCL prompt?", "input": "Syntax: catalog file.reference itemlist* {(options)}\n\nThe catalog BASIC program creates an entry in the master dictionary of the current account, making the specified BASIC or BASIC program executable directly from the TCL prompt.", "output": "Use the catalog command with the file reference and program name, such as 'catalog bp testprog'. This creates an entry in the master dictionary, allowing you to run the program by simply typing its name at the TCL prompt."}
{"instruction": "What happens if I try to catalog a program with a name that already exists?", "input": "Parameter(s): o - Overwrites any existing items, except for file-defining items and Q-pointers. Warning: If an item exists in the master dictionary with the same name as the program and it is not a cataloged program pointer item, the catalog process fails and does not write over the conflicting master dictionary item.", "output": "By default, cataloging fails if a non-program item exists with the same name. Use the 'o' option to overwrite existing cataloged programs, but it won't overwrite file-defining items or Q-pointers. If there's a naming conflict with other item types, you must resolve it manually."}
{"instruction": "Can I catalog programs without having the source code present?", "input": "Note: On all D3 platforms, a program can be cataloged without the source being present. All external subroutines must be cataloged.", "output": "Yes, you can catalog compiled BASIC programs even when the source code is not present on the system. However, remember that all external subroutines used by your programs must also be cataloged for the program to execute properly."}
{"instruction": "How would I change to a specific directory and have it persist during my session?", "input": "Syntax: cd {new.directory}\n\nThe cd BASIC program changes the current working directory to the specified new directory. The new directory remains until the D3 process is disconnected (not logged off) or a new cd command is issued.", "output": "Use 'cd /path/to/directory' to change to a specific directory. For example, 'cd /tmp' changes to the tmp directory. The change persists until you disconnect from D3 or issue another cd command. Running 'cd' without parameters returns to your home directory."}
{"instruction": "How would I modify the definition code of a file to prevent it from being saved during a file-save operation?", "input": "CHANGE-FILE filename [(options)]\n\nThe change-file command changes the File Definition Code of a file. Options include:\nX - Changes the file to a DX-type file, indicating that the file will not be saved during a file-save. The file will not exist following a file-restore.\nZ - Changes the file to a DX-type file, indicating that the file will not be saved during a file-save. The file will not exist following a file-restore.", "output": "Use the CHANGE-FILE command with either the X or Z option. Both options change the file to a DX-type file that will not be saved during a file-save operation. For example: `CHANGE-FILE DATA SALES (X` changes the SALES data file to a DX-type file that won't be saved during file-save operations."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between using X and Y options when changing a file definition code?", "input": "CHANGE-FILE filename [(options)]\n\nOptions:\nX - Changes the file to a DX-type file, indicating that the file will not be saved during a file-save. The file will not exist following a file-restore.\nY - Changes the file to a DY-type file, indicating that only the file sizing parameters will be saved, not its data, during a file-save. The file will be empty following a file-restore.", "output": "The X option creates a DX-type file that will not be saved at all during file-save operations and won't exist after file-restore. The Y option creates a DY-type file where only the file sizing parameters are saved during file-save, but not the actual data - the file will exist but be empty after file-restore."}
{"instruction": "Show me the syntax for changing a data file that's part of multiple files associated with a single dictionary.", "input": "CHANGE-FILE account-name,dict-name,data-name [(options)]\n\nUse this format to change a data file that is one of multiple files associated with a single dictionary.", "output": "Use the format `CHANGE-FILE account-name,dict-name,data-name [(options)]`. For example, if you have multiple data files associated with a dictionary called 'invoices' in the 'sales' account, you would specify the exact data file name: `CHANGE-FILE sales,invoices,archive (X`"}
{"instruction": "Under what circumstances would I need to use the R option with CHANGE-FILE?", "input": "CHANGE-FILE filename [(options)]\n\nR - Changes the definition code of a file in another account.", "output": "Use the R option when you need to change the definition code of a file that exists in a different account from the one you're currently working in. This allows cross-account file definition modifications."}
{"instruction": "How do I change the current accounting charges accumulation to track usage under a specific project?", "input": "charge-to text.string\n\nThe charge-to command changes the current accounting charges accumulation. Subsequent usage statistics are accumulated to a new accounting entity composed of the user-ID, followed by the specified charge to text string.", "output": "Use the `charge-to` command followed by your project identifier. For example: `charge-to mastercard` will accumulate subsequent usage statistics under your user-ID followed by 'mastercard'. The charges are tracked in the dm,acc file if the accounting flag is set."}
{"instruction": "What information is displayed when I check accounting charges after using charge-to?", "input": "Example: who37 dm krbcharge-to mastercard<connect time= 121 mins.; CPU= 23747 units; lptr pages= 4>who37 dm*mastercard krb\n\nconnect time - Number of minutes the account has been logged on\nCPU - Number of CPU units used by the account\nlptr pages - Number of pages sent to the printer (spooler)", "output": "After using charge-to, the who command will show your accounting information including: connect time (minutes logged on), CPU units consumed, and lptr pages (pages sent to printer/spooler). The display format shows your user-ID followed by an asterisk and the charge-to string."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to validate workspace integrity for a specific port, and what does the output mean?", "input": "check-ws {port.number}\n\nThe check-ws BASIC program validates the integrity of the workspace for a given port. If successful, displays: 0000 00\nwhere 0000 is workspace status and 00 is level.", "output": "Yes, use `check-ws port.number` to validate workspace integrity for a specific port. Successful validation shows '0000 00' where the first four digits represent workspace status (0000 means good) and the last two digits show the level. Non-zero status codes indicate various workspace problems that can be diagnosed using the provided bit pattern table."}
{"instruction": "How would I troubleshoot a workspace that shows status 0040 at level 01?", "input": "check-ws 49\nOutput: 0040 01\n\nWorkspace status tally bits are grouped as: abcd efgh ijkl mnop\nwhere specific bit positions indicate different types of workspace problems including bad pcb, bad workspace, etc.", "output": "A status of 0040 at level 01 indicates that the basic workspace is bad (bit position shows workspace corruption). The 01 indicates the process is at level 01. You would need to refer to the complete bit pattern table to diagnose the specific workspace components that are corrupted and take appropriate corrective action."}
{"instruction": "When would I need to change tape device characteristics, and what platforms support this?", "input": "chg-device device.number option=value {option=value...}\n\nThe chg-device command changes a tape device. Changes made are not permanent and are lost when the virtual machine is rebooted.\nFor Windows: Not Supported", "output": "Use chg-device to modify tape device behavior or replace one device with another on UNIX systems only (not supported on Windows). Common scenarios include changing device names, adjusting density settings, or modifying block sizes. Remember that changes are temporary and lost upon reboot, so they're typically used for testing or temporary configurations."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to change a pseudo tape device to use a different file location.", "input": "chg-device 7 name=/tmp/pseudotp\n\nname=newname - Specifies a new device name. Spaces are not allowed. Length cannot exceed 63 characters.", "output": "Use the name option to specify the new file path: `chg-device 7 name=/tmp/pseudotp`. This changes device 7 to use the /tmp/pseudotp file as the pseudo tape location. The new name cannot contain spaces and must be 63 characters or fewer."}
{"instruction": "What's the purpose of calculating checksums for file items, and where are the results stored?", "input": "chksum file.reference itemlist*{(options}\n\nCalculates a hexadecimal checksum for either an entire file or a list of items, and outputs results to a file. A new data section called 'checksum' is created in the specified file with hexadecimal checksums in the first attribute of each item.", "output": "The chksum command calculates hexadecimal checksums for data integrity verification. Results are stored in a new 'checksum' data section within the same file, where each item corresponds to an item in the original data section. The first attribute of each checksum item contains the hexadecimal checksum value for verification purposes."}
{"instruction": "How do I clear a file while preserving its structure and what's the difference between clearing data vs dictionary sections?", "input": "clear-file {(}{data} file.reference{,file.reference}) {(options}\nclear-file {(}dict file.reference){(options}\n\nClears the dictionary or data section of specified file of all items and retains the primary file space area. To clear dictionary section, 'dict' must be specified before file reference. If dictionary is specified, file-defining items (D-pointers) are not cleared.", "output": "Use `clear-file data filename` to clear the data section or `clear-file dict filename` to clear the dictionary section. Clearing data removes all data items but preserves file structure. Clearing dictionary removes all items except D-pointers (file-defining items), maintaining the file's basic definition. Both operations retain the file's name, base, and modulo settings."}
{"instruction": "What safety considerations should I be aware of when using clear-file?", "input": "Warning: The clear-file command does not require confirmation.\n\nThe clear-file command only clears the file, it does not delete it. Options include:\nl - No logging—no log of the clear-file is placed in the file of files", "output": "Be extremely cautious as clear-file executes immediately without confirmation prompts. It permanently removes all items from the specified section but preserves the file structure. Use the 'l' option to prevent logging if clearing temporary files frequently, which can improve performance but reduces audit trails."}
{"instruction": "How would I remove all indexes from a specific file at once?", "input": "clear-index file.reference *{(options)}\n\nClears the specified B-tree index expression in the specified file, leaving only a null root. * - Clears all indexes.", "output": "Use the asterisk (*) wildcard: `clear-index invoices *`. This clears all B-tree indexes from the invoices file, leaving only null roots for each index. This is useful when rebuilding all indexes or troubleshooting index corruption issues."}
{"instruction": "What's the syntax for clearing an index based on a specific attribute with case sensitivity?", "input": "clear-index file.reference a.code{(options)}\n\na.code - Specifies the a processing code used in forming index keys. Must include attribute number immediately after the 'a'.\nc - Specifies a case sensitive index. Default is case insensitive.", "output": "Use `clear-index entity a1 (c` to clear a case-sensitive index on attribute 1 of the entity file. The 'a' processing code must be followed immediately by the attribute number, and the 'c' option specifies case sensitivity (default is case insensitive)."}
{"instruction": "When would I need to clear locks for a specific frame-ID versus a port number?", "input": "clear-locks {host}{(options}\n\nf{fid} - Clears all group and item locks for a specific frame-ID, specified as decimal number\nThe f option indicates the number immediately following it is a frame-ID. Without the f option, the number is interpreted as a port number.", "output": "Use frame-ID clearing (`clear-locks (f12345`) when you need to clear locks associated with specific file groups or items, regardless of which port created them. Use port number clearing (`clear-locks (g3`) when you want to clear all locks created by a specific user session. Frame-ID targeting is more precise for addressing specific resource locks."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to clear different types of locks selectively.", "input": "Options:\nb - Clears all BASIC locks\nm - Clears all phantom locks  \nq - Clears all spooler locks\ns - Clears all system locks\nt - Clears Transaction Log locks", "output": "Use specific option letters to target lock types: `clear-locks (b` for BASIC locks, `clear-locks (m` for phantom locks, `clear-locks (q` for spooler locks, `clear-locks (s` for system locks, or `clear-locks (t` for Transaction Log locks. This allows selective lock clearing without affecting other lock types."}
{"instruction": "How can I monitor what commands users are currently executing on the system?", "input": "cmdu {(options}\n\nThe cmdu command from DM produces a report of the last TCL command issued by every active user on the system.", "output": "Use the `cmdu` command to generate a real-time report showing the last TCL command executed by each active user. The report displays PIB number, location, user name, mode, and the last command issued, helping administrators monitor system activity and user operations."}
{"instruction": "What information does the cmdu report provide about active users?", "input": "Example output:\nPage 1 dm,pibs, 10:23:40 19 Feb 2003\npib# location user md last.cmd\n27 Dick Parr dp ba lu\n60 Andy Meyers am qa m\n41 Sam Smith ss ba main", "output": "The cmdu report shows: PIB number (process identifier), location/terminal name, username, current mode (ba=BASIC, qa=query access, etc.), and the last TCL command executed. This provides administrators with a snapshot of current user activity and system usage patterns."}
{"instruction": "How do I compare items between files to identify differences, and what output formats are available?", "input": "compare file.reference itemlist* {(options)}\nwith: {(file.reference} itemlist\n\nOptions:\nc - Combines output into one-column format, rather than two-column split-screen format\nz - Lists only lines with differences and displays item-IDs only of identical items", "output": "Use `compare entity 12345 (z with:(entity,archive 12345` to compare items between files. The 'c' option provides single-column output instead of split-screen format, while 'z' shows only differing lines and just displays item-IDs for identical items, making it easier to focus on actual changes."}
{"instruction": "What assembly language specific options are available when comparing code?", "input": "Options:\na - Compares all elements on each attribute. Default is first three elements, delimited with spaces (assembler source general format)\nb - Compares entire first value of attribute for assembly object code\nd - Does not compare object code addresses for compiled assembly programs\no - Compares entire attribute except first value for assembly object code", "output": "For assembly code comparison: use 'a' to compare all elements per attribute (default compares only first three), 'b' to compare complete first values for object code, 'd' to ignore address differences in compiled code, and 'o' to compare entire attributes except the first value and subvalue for object code analysis."}
{"instruction": "How would I create a union of two lists and save the result to a third list?", "input": "compare-list list1 = list2 list3 (gs\n\nOperators:\n= - Represents a or union, indicating that item-IDs can exist in either list\nOptions:\ng - Performs a get-list on listc (makes listc active after process)\ns - Generates and displays statistics", "output": "Use `compare-list list1 = list2 list3 (gs` to create a union. The '=' operator combines all unique item-IDs from both lists into list3. The 'g' option activates list3 after creation, and 's' displays statistics about the operation, showing how many items were processed."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between intersection (&) and exclusion (#) operations on lists?", "input": "Operators:\n& - Represents and or intersection, which means item-IDs must exist in both lists\n# - Represents not or exclusion, which means item IDs must not exist in both lists", "output": "Intersection (&) returns only item-IDs that exist in BOTH lists - the common elements. Exclusion (#) returns item-IDs that exist in either list but NOT in both - essentially everything except the common elements. For example, if list1 has {A,B,C} and list2 has {B,C,D}, intersection gives {B,C} while exclusion gives {A,D}."}
{"instruction": "How do I compile BASIC programs with optimization and what are the performance implications?", "input": "compile file.reference itemlist* {(options}\n\no - Produces a FlashBASIC optimized code\nWarning: Compilation with the (o flag might take a long time to compile and tends to use a great deal of the machine's resources.", "output": "Use `compile bp program (o` to create FlashBASIC optimized code. While this produces faster-executing programs, be aware that compilation takes significantly longer and consumes substantial system resources. The optimization is worthwhile for frequently-used programs but may not be suitable during heavy system usage periods."}
{"instruction": "What debugging options are available during BASIC compilation?", "input": "Options:\nc - Compresses object by suppressing end-of-line opcodes. Removes ability to single-step with BASIC debugger\nd - Prevents the runtime d option from entering the debugger\nq - Suppresses generation of symbol table used exclusively by the BASIC/FlashBASIC debugger", "output": "For debugging: avoid 'c' option if you need debugging capability (it removes line counting and single-stepping). Use 'd' to prevent runtime debugger entry. The 'q' option removes symbol tables that debuggers need, so only use it for production code where debugging isn't required."}
{"instruction": "How can I convert text case while preserving quoted strings in TCL statements?", "input": "conv-case file.reference itemlist*{(options)}\n\ne - Used with q option to convert case of items within quotation marks due to chain, tcl, and execute statements\nq - Leaves text within quotation marks unchanged", "output": "Use `conv-case bp * (equ` to convert to uppercase while preserving quoted strings. The 'q' option protects all quoted text, while 'e' specifically handles quotation marks in chain, tcl, and execute statements. The 'u' option ensures conversion to uppercase (which is the default behavior)."}
{"instruction": "What are the capture options available when using converse mode?", "input": "Options:\nc - Captures all output on the (slave) screen and writes it to an item in the dm,cap-file\ni - Same as c option, except output from master process is captured\nz - Translate nonprintable characters into periods, carriage returns into attribute marks, suppress line feeds", "output": "Use 'c' to capture slave screen output, 'i' to capture master process output, and 'z' to clean up captured data by converting nonprintables to periods and carriage returns to attribute marks. The 'z' option prevents item truncation from x'ff' characters and makes captured data more readable."}
{"instruction": "How do I set a custom termination sequence for converse mode?", "input": "d/hexnum{,hexnum...} - Designates the sequence of characters to terminate converse mode. Each character is provided in hexadecimal equivalent of ASCII value, separated by commas.\n\nExample: d/41,42,43,44 indicates that \"ABCD\" disconnects the link", "output": "Use the d/ option followed by comma-separated hex values: `converse 3 (d/2a,2b,2b` sets the termination sequence to *++. Each character must be specified as its hexadecimal ASCII value. For example, d/41,42,43,44 creates an \"ABCD\" termination sequence."}
{"instruction": "What's the safest way to copy items between files when duplicate item-IDs might exist?", "input": "copy file.reference itemlist*{(options)}\nto: {(file.reference} {itemlist}\n\nOptions:\no - Overwrites existing items when duplicate item-IDs exist\nu - If item-ID exists in destination, creates new item-ID by concatenating original with letter starting with lowercase 'a'", "output": "Use the 'u' option for safety: `copy invoices * (u to:(backup.invoices`. This automatically renames duplicates by appending letters (a, b, c, etc.) to preserve both versions. The 'o' option overwrites existing items, which is faster but destructive - only use when you're certain you want to replace existing data."}
{"instruction": "How can I copy items while removing the originals in a single operation?", "input": "Options:\nd - Deletes original source item after copying. Not valid with the t or p option", "output": "Use the 'd' option: `copy temp.file * (d to:(archive.file`. This moves items by copying them to the destination and then deleting the originals. Note that this option cannot be used with 't' (terminal output) or 'p' (printer output) since those don't represent permanent storage locations."}
{"instruction": "What's the advantage of using copy-list over the regular copy command for saved lists?", "input": "copy-list {{file.reference} {itemlist*} {(options}\nto: {(file.reference} {itemlist}\n\nA file reference may be specified because any file can hold lists. The copy command may also be used, but copy-list defaults to the pointer-file.", "output": "copy-list automatically defaults to the pointer-file, making it more convenient for list operations. While copy command can also handle lists, you'd need to explicitly specify the pointer-file location. copy-list is specifically designed for list management and provides more intuitive defaults for list-related operations."}
{"instruction": "How can I send program output to a printer using the cp command?", "input": "Syntax: cp file.reference itemlist*{(options}\nThe cp BASIC program copies the specified items to the printer via the spooler.\nOptions: n-Integer number that specifies the number of items to copy, a-Activates assembly list format, f-Outputs a form feed between each item, s-Suppresses display of line numbers, x-Outputs in hexadecimal.", "output": "The cp command copies specified items to the printer via the spooler. Use the syntax: cp file.reference itemlist* followed by optional parameters in parentheses. You can specify the number of items to copy with 'n', activate assembly list format with 'a', output form feeds between items with 'f', suppress line numbers with 's', or output in hexadecimal with 'x'."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between cp and ct commands for copying items?", "input": "cp command - copies specified items to the printer via the spooler\nct command - invokes the copy command and copies the specified items to the terminal\nBoth use similar syntax: file.reference itemlist* {(options)}", "output": "The main difference is the destination: cp copies items to the printer via the spooler, while ct copies items to the terminal for display. Both commands use identical syntax and support the same options (n for number of items, a for assembly format, f for form feeds, s to suppress line numbers, x for hexadecimal output), but cp sends output to a printer while ct displays output on the terminal."}
{"instruction": "Show me an example of using the cp command with assembly format.", "input": "Example: cp dm,bp, term-type\nOptions include: a-Activates assembly list format, f-Outputs a form feed between each item, s-Suppresses display of line numbers", "output": "Here's an example: cp dm,bp, term-type. To use assembly format, you would add the 'a' option like this: cp dm,bp, term-type (a. This activates assembly list format when copying the specified items to the printer."}
{"instruction": "Under what circumstances would I need to create a new ABS area?", "input": "The create-abs command sets aside a contiguous set of frames as the destination for loading the ABS code (the D3 virtual code). This space is called the ABS area. This command provides the ability to create a whole new executable ABS to avoid the risk of corrupting the existing ABS.", "output": "You would need to create a new ABS area when you want to avoid the risk of corrupting the existing ABS (Absolute code area). The create-abs command is used to set aside contiguous frames for loading D3 virtual code, allowing you to create a whole new executable ABS area separate from the current one. This is particularly useful during system maintenance or when testing new code implementations."}
{"instruction": "How do I copy system modes from a boot ABS when creating a new ABS area?", "input": "Syntax: create-abs file.reference([l|{z} number])\nParameter 'l' prompts user for source file and copies the system modes from the source abs used in booting the system (boot abs) to the destination ABS area, initializing the file for future loads.", "output": "Use the 'l' option with the create-abs command: create-abs file.reference (l. This will prompt you for a source file and copy the system modes from the source ABS (typically the boot ABS) to your new destination ABS area, automatically initializing it for future loads. If you don't specify a numeric parameter, it uses the ABS size of the source file to create the ABS area."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I use the 'z' option in create-abs?", "input": "Parameter '{z}number' - z, followed by a number, zeroes out the frames in the ABS area. This option requires a numeric parameter to specify the size of the ABS area, and is incompatible with the 'l' option.", "output": "The 'z' option followed by a number zeroes out the frames in the ABS area. You must specify a numeric parameter to define the size of the ABS area when using this option. Note that 'z' is incompatible with the 'l' option - you cannot use both simultaneously. For example: create-abs myfile (z100 would zero out 100 frames in the ABS area."}
{"instruction": "Can you walk me through creating a new account with security considerations?", "input": "The create-account BASIC program creates a new master dictionary, copies all the necessary items into it, and updates the mds file with the name and address. The newac file in the dm account contains the items that are placed into a new account master dictionary. For security purposes, items can be removed from newac as well. For example, dangerous commands such as delete-file and clear-file could be either removed or renamed to prevent accidental use.", "output": "To create a new account, use create-account with the account name. The system creates a master dictionary and copies items from the 'newac' file in the dm account. For security, you can modify the newac file before creating accounts - remove or rename dangerous commands like delete-file and clear-file to prevent accidental use. The system automatically updates the mds file with the new account's name and address information."}
{"instruction": "What's the purpose of the 'h' option when creating accounts for Hot-Backup?", "input": "Options: h-For Hot-Backup purposes, suppresses updates to the new account from newac items, l-For Hot-Backup purposes, specifies that files in the account are logged, t-For Hot-Backup purposes, specifies that files in the account are not logged", "output": "The 'h' option in create-account suppresses updates to the new account from newac items specifically for Hot-Backup purposes. This prevents the standard newac items from being copied into the new account during creation. This option works alongside other Hot-Backup options like 'l' (enables logging) and 't' (disables logging) to configure backup behavior for the new account."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to create case-sensitive accounts in D3?", "input": "Options: s-Creates a case sensitive account. The account type becomes 'DS-pointer account indicates case-sensitivity (local)'", "output": "Yes, you can create case-sensitive accounts using the 's' option with create-account. For example: create-account myaccount (s. This creates an account where item-IDs and other identifiers are case-sensitive. The account type will show as 'DS-pointer account indicates case-sensitivity (local)' instead of the standard 'D' type."}
{"instruction": "How would I create a file with both dictionary and data sections?", "input": "Syntax: create-file file.reference dict.modulo data.modulo{(options)}\nFirst form creates a new file with both data and dictionary sections.\nExample: create-file customers 7 101", "output": "Use the first form of create-file syntax: create-file file.reference dict.modulo data.modulo. For example: create-file customers 7 101 creates a file named 'customers' with a dictionary section using modulo 7 and a data section using modulo 101. This creates both sections simultaneously in a single command."}
{"instruction": "When should I use the 'q' option with create-file?", "input": "Option 'q': Prevents files from being resized. This allows sequential commands (for example, count) to be used without having to update the File Control Block. Warning: Administrators should not clear the q d-code and start a resize unless you are certain that there are no sequential operations in progress on the file.", "output": "Use the 'q' option when you want to prevent automatic file resizing, which allows sequential commands like 'count' to run without updating the File Control Block. This can improve performance for certain operations. However, be very careful when removing the 'q' d-code later - ensure no sequential operations are running on the file before starting a resize, as this can cause problems."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between creating a dictionary-only file versus a regular file?", "input": "Second form creates a new file with only a dictionary section: create-file dict file.reference dict.modulo{(options)}\nWhen a dictionary-only file is created, a Q-pointer (synonym-defining item) with the file reference as its item-ID, is automatically created in the dictionary.", "output": "A dictionary-only file contains no data section, only the dictionary for storing attribute definitions and other metadata. Use: create-file dict file.reference dict.modulo. The system automatically creates a Q-pointer (synonym-defining item) in the dictionary with the file reference as its item-ID, allowing the file to be accessed without specifying 'dict'. This is useful for files that only need to store definitions or reference information."}
{"instruction": "How can I create an index on multiple concatenated attributes?", "input": "Syntax: create-index file.reference a.code{(options)}\nExample 3: Creates an index on attribute 1 concatenated with attribute 3: create-index sales a1:3", "output": "To create an index on concatenated attributes, use the colon (:) operator in your a.code. For example: create-index sales a1:3 creates an index on attribute 1 concatenated with attribute 3 in the 'sales' file. The colon combines the values from both attributes into a single index key."}
{"instruction": "When would I need to use numeric indexes instead of regular indexes?", "input": "Option 'n': Creates numeric indexes. Numeric indexes are sorted according to their numerical value. For example: '10.5' is greater than '9.34' and '9 June 1980' is less than '1 Aug 2010'. Because the locale is used to determine the thousands and decimal separators, it is strongly recommended to store numerics in scaled internal format.", "output": "Use numeric indexes when you need proper numerical sorting instead of alphabetical sorting. Regular indexes would sort '10.5' before '9.34' alphabetically, but numeric indexes correctly recognize that 10.5 > 9.34. They also handle dates properly ('9 June 1980' < '1 Aug 2010'). Store numbers in scaled internal format without separators to ensure consistent behavior across different locales."}
{"instruction": "What's the risk of using translate correlatives when creating indexes?", "input": "Warning: You cannot create an index with a translate to the same file. For Windows: Great caution should be taken when using translates during index creation since index corruption can occur. To employ translates, the file reference must contain the full path to the file.", "output": "When using translate correlatives in index creation, you risk index corruption, especially on Windows systems. You cannot create an index with a translate to the same file. On Windows, you must use fully-pathed file references (like fsidm,tfile2) when employing translates. For UNIX systems, use the 's' (subindex) processing code instead to safely employ translates."}
{"instruction": "How do I create a macro that executes immediately without displaying the command?", "input": "Options: n-Creates a nonstop macro, which executes immediately upon activation, without displaying the TCL command being issued by the macro. Attribute 1 becomes an 'n'. m-Creates a pause and display type macro (default).", "output": "Use the 'n' option with create-macro: create-macro macroname (n. This creates a nonstop macro that executes immediately when activated without showing the TCL command. The macro's attribute 1 becomes 'n'. This is opposite to the default 'm' type which pauses and displays the command before execution."}
{"instruction": "Can I pass parameters to a macro when I execute it?", "input": "During activation of the macro, any additional parameters following the macro name at the TCL prompt, are passed into the first executable command in the macro, but do not affect any other commands in the macro.", "output": "Yes, you can pass parameters to a macro. When you execute the macro by typing its name followed by parameters at the TCL prompt, those parameters are passed to the first executable command in the macro. However, the parameters only affect the first command - they don't carry over to any subsequent commands within the same macro."}
{"instruction": "What happens if I try to create a macro with a name that already exists?", "input": "If the macro name already exists, a message is given. Note: The 'o' option allows overwriting it.\nExample: If the show.entity macro was present, the message displays: [415] 'show.entity' exists on file.", "output": "If you try to create a macro with an existing name, you'll get an error message like '[415] 'macroname' exists on file.' To overwrite an existing macro, use the 'o' option: create-macro macroname (o. Without this option, the system protects existing macros from being accidentally overwritten."}
{"instruction": "How does the crt-device command affect BASIC @ functions?", "input": "The crt-device command forces BASIC and FlashBASIC to use the CRT terminal device instead of the printer device for the @ functions with the printer in the ON state. If crt-device state is ON (1378), then the terminal device is used for @ functions.", "output": "The crt-device command controls where BASIC @ functions send their output. When crt-device is ON, @ functions use the terminal device even if the printer is ON. When crt-device is OFF, @ functions follow the printer state - using the printer device if printer is ON, or the terminal device if printer is OFF. This gives you fine-grained control over @ function output routing."}
{"instruction": "What's the purpose of the cvtcpy utility and what formats does it support?", "input": "The cvtcpy utility in the DM account copies a tape to another tape, including format and block conversions, and reads D3, CIE, Reality or Ultimate tape formats, with a block size up to 64 KB, and creates a D3 tape.", "output": "The cvtcpy utility is used for tape-to-tape copying with format conversion capabilities. It can read multiple input formats (D3, CIE, Reality, or Ultimate) with block sizes up to 64 KB and always creates a D3 format output tape. This is useful for migrating data between different system formats or creating standardized D3 backups from various source formats."}
{"instruction": "Why might the last block be padded when using cvtcpy?", "input": "Since the data block sizes can be different, the very last block may be padded with segment block characters (decimal 252). This should impact D3 tapes (t-dump/save), but may affect applications reading the tapes by some other means.", "output": "Block padding occurs in cvtcpy because source and destination tapes may have different block sizes. The utility pads the final block with segment block characters (decimal 252) to meet the destination format requirements. While this doesn't affect standard D3 tape operations like t-dump/save, it may impact custom applications that read the tapes directly, so be aware of this when processing cvtcpy output tapes."}
{"instruction": "How can I connect to a remote VME from MS-DOS using D3Tcl?", "input": "The D3Tcl command connects a remote VME with a TCL command from MS-DOS. Options include: -d database (defines database), -n vme (defines VME name), -u user,password (overrides Windows user)", "output": "Use D3Tcl with connection options: D3Tcl -d database -n vmename -u username,password. The -d specifies the target database, -n specifies the VME name (or computer name), and -u allows you to override the Windows user with a D3 user and password. If environment variables %D3DATABASE% and %D3VME% are set, you can omit those parameters."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to execute multiple commands with D3Tcl and return to MS-DOS?", "input": "Option -c cmd: Defines a command to be processed. When using this flag, only one command can be processed. If there is more than one -c switch, the commands are executed in the specified order before returning to MS-DOS.", "output": "Yes, you can execute multiple commands by using multiple -c switches. Each -c defines one command, and if you specify multiple -c options, D3Tcl executes them in order before returning to MS-DOS. For example: D3Tcl -c \"command1\" -c \"command2\" -c \"command3\" will execute all three commands sequentially and then exit back to MS-DOS."}
{"instruction": "How do I display a calendar for a specific month using the date command?", "input": "Option 'c': Produces a calendar of the month containing the given date. The operator is then given the choices: D = Previous Month, F = Next Month, X = Exit, Y = Previous Year, U = Next Year. Option 'n': Displays the calendar only when used with the 'c' option, and does not prompt for additional options.", "output": "Use the 'c' option: date somedate (c. This displays a calendar for the month containing the specified date and provides navigation options (D for previous month, F for next month, Y/U for previous/next year, X to exit). If you want to display the calendar without interactive navigation, combine with 'n': date somedate (cn."}
{"instruction": "Can the date command handle different date formats as input?", "input": "Date parameter: Date to convert and display. It may be in external, internal, or Julian date format. If the date is not provided, the current system date is the default date. Option 'j': Indicates that the date parameter is a Julian number.", "output": "Yes, the date command accepts multiple input formats: external dates (like 2/1/2003), internal dates (numeric), or Julian dates. If you're providing a Julian date, use the 'j' option to specify the format. If no date is provided, it uses the current system date. The command then displays the date in all three formats (external, internal, and Julian) for reference."}
{"instruction": "What happens when data carrier detect is lost on a port?", "input": "When activated, this protocol allows the system to sense changes in the dcd signal. When the system senses a loss of the dcd signal on a port, it logs the port off. When the dcd is lost, the process is interrupted by a UNIX HANGUP signal that forces it to execute the TCL command specified by the trap command.", "output": "When data carrier detect (dcd) is lost on a port, the system automatically logs off that port. The process receives a UNIX HANGUP signal, which interrupts normal operation and forces execution of any TCL command that was specified with the trap command. This provides automatic cleanup and logout functionality when modem connections are lost."}
{"instruction": "How do I enable data carrier detect on a specific port?", "input": "Options: port.number - displays or changes settings for the port number. If not specified, the dcd command is set on the current port. 'n' - Sets the dcd command to On (Data carrier detect is active). 'f' - Sets the dcd command to Off.", "output": "To enable dcd on a specific port, use: dcd portnumber n. For example: dcd 16 n enables data carrier detect on port 16. Use 'f' instead of 'n' to disable it: dcd 16 f. If you don't specify a port number, the command applies to your current port."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between catalog and decatalog commands?", "input": "The decatalog command removes the compiled BASIC or FlashBASIC object code of the specified items from the dictionary of the specified file, and removes the corresponding command entry (or entries) from the master dictionary of the current account. A program does not have to be previously cataloged to be decataloged.", "output": "The decatalog command is the reverse of catalog - it removes compiled object code from the dictionary and removes command entries from the master dictionary, making programs unavailable for execution. Interestingly, you can decatalog a program even if it wasn't previously cataloged; decatalog will still remove any existing object code. This is useful for cleanup operations."}
{"instruction": "When would I need to decrypt a file, and what are the requirements?", "input": "The decrypt-file command returns an encrypted file back to its original unencrypted format. To remove encryption, you must be logged into the account in which the specified file exists. If the encrypt processing code is on the file-defining item, then only the specified attributes will be encrypted and available for decryption.", "output": "You need to decrypt a file when you want to remove encryption and return it to plain text format. You must be logged into the account containing the encrypted file to decrypt it. If the file uses encrypt processing codes on specific attributes, only those designated attributes will be decrypted. The command works on entire files or specific data sections within a file."}
{"instruction": "How does the define-up program help with keyboard configuration?", "input": "The define-up BASIC program provides a front-end for defining a keyboard for the Update processor. It builds a keyboard item that is used by the set-imap program to translate the keyboard keys entered into Update processor commands. After filing the item in the define-up program, then execute a set-imap terminal-name (c command to put the new translations into effect.", "output": "The define-up program creates custom keyboard mappings for the Update processor by building a keyboard item that defines key-to-command translations. After creating these definitions with define-up, you must run 'set-imap terminal-name (c' to activate the new keyboard translations. This two-step process allows you to customize how keys are interpreted within the Update processor for specific terminal types."}

{"instruction": "How does the onneterror subroutine help handle network errors during file operations?", "input": "onneterror is a globally cataloged subroutine that can be called from the FSI when a network error occurs during FlashBASIC file I/Os. This allows users to break out of the error and customize the subroutine. The subroutine is available in the dm account of the FSI (fsi:dm,basicprograms, onneterror). Syntax: onneterror(environment, operation, errorcode, module, filename, item-ID, action). Parameters include environment (0=Generic I/O, 1=From VME), operation (read, write, open, etc.), and action (0=Ignore, 1=Abort, 2=Debug).", "output": "The onneterror subroutine provides custom error handling for network errors during FlashBASIC file I/O operations. When a network error occurs, this globally cataloged subroutine is called with parameters indicating the environment, operation type, error code, module name, filename, and item ID. You can customize the action parameter to ignore the error (0), abort the program (1), or drop into the debugger (2). This allows for sophisticated error recovery and debugging capabilities in networked file operations."}
{"instruction": "What does the overflow command tell me about available disk space?", "input": "The overflow command displays the system overflow table which contains the addresses of available disk frames. All unused frames are available for use by the spooler, the D3 file system, and the process workspace. Options include: a - Lists start and end FIDs for each block, b - Lists total frames for each contiguous block, o - Displays the old safe table, s - Displays only safe blocks, t - Displays blocks in safe table with asterisk.", "output": "The overflow command shows information about available disk space by displaying the system overflow table, which tracks unused disk frames available for the spooler, D3 file system, and process workspace. The output includes total overflow frames, reserved frames, number of contiguous blocks, B-tree levels, and leaf count. Various options let you see detailed block information, filter by size, view historical safe table data, or focus on specific frame ranges."}
{"instruction": "Why would I use the overflow command with different options for system analysis?", "input": "The overflow command has various options: a - Lists start/end FIDs and sizes with filtering capability, b - Lists total frames per contiguous block with size filtering, c - Only counts frames in final counts, o - Displays old safe table from before last save, s - Displays only safe blocks, t - Shows safe table blocks with asterisk. Example output: overflow: 8450 reserve: 1024 blocks: 669 b-tree levels: 2 leaves: 9", "output": "Different overflow options serve specific analysis needs: Use 'a' to analyze fragmentation by seeing start/end frame IDs and block sizes, 'b' to understand block distribution and identify large contiguous areas, 'o' to compare current overflow with the state before the last save operation, 's' to focus on safe blocks that survive system crashes, and 't' to identify which blocks are marked as safe. This information helps with system performance tuning, storage optimization, and understanding disk space fragmentation patterns."}
{"instruction": "How can I monitor overflow consumption across multiple ports simultaneously?", "input": "Command: ovf-monitor\nSyntax: ovf-monitor {*|port{,port}{-port}...} {(options}\nDescription: The ovf-monitor command monitors and displays overflow consumption on a port by port basis.\nParameters: * monitors all ports (default), port specifications for specific ports/ranges, options include 'a' for all target ports, 's' for scroll mode, 'tn' for refresh interval in seconds (default 10).", "output": "Use the ovf-monitor command with the asterisk (*) parameter to monitor all ports simultaneously: `ovf-monitor *`. This is actually the default behavior, so you can also just run `ovf-monitor` without any parameters. The display will show overflow consumption data for all ports, refreshing every 10 seconds by default. You can modify the refresh interval using the 't' option followed by the number of seconds, like `ovf-monitor * (t5` for 5-second intervals."}
{"instruction": "What does it mean when I see negative values in the ovf-monitor output columns?", "input": "Command: ovf-monitor\nNote: Negative values displayed in either the Ovf used or Total columns indicate a condition where a port released more overflow frames than it consumed. For example, if a user creates a file on port 1 and then subsequently deletes the file using port 2, the port 2 Ovf used value would display a negative number indicating the difference between the number of overflow frames that have been released and consumed by that line.", "output": "Negative values in the 'Ovf used' or 'Total' columns indicate that a port has released more overflow frames than it consumed. This typically happens when operations are performed across different ports - for instance, if a file is created on port 1 but deleted from port 2, port 2 will show a negative 'Ovf used' value. The negative number represents the difference between overflow frames released versus consumed by that specific port."}
{"instruction": "Is there a way to continuously monitor just one specific port with automatic scrolling?", "input": "Command: ovf-monitor\nSyntax: ovf-monitor {*|port{,port}{-port}...} {(options}\nOptions: s - Enables scroll mode. Each new occurrence of activity is displayed as a new line in the output display. Note that older entries will scroll off the screen when the screen becomes full.\nExample: ovf-monitor 20 (st2 - monitors port 20 with scrolling display that refreshes every 2 seconds.", "output": "Yes, you can monitor a specific port with continuous scrolling using the 's' option. For example, `ovf-monitor 20 (st2` will monitor only port 20 with scroll mode enabled and refresh every 2 seconds. In scroll mode, each new activity occurrence appears as a new line, and older entries will scroll off the screen when it becomes full. This is particularly useful for tracking activity patterns on a single port over time."}
{"instruction": "How do I display all target ports in ovf-monitor, even those not actively consuming overflow?", "input": "Command: ovf-monitor\nOptions: a - Displays all target ports. By default, only the ports that are actively consuming overflow are displayed.", "output": "Use the 'a' option with ovf-monitor to display all target ports: `ovf-monitor (a`. By default, ovf-monitor only shows ports that are actively consuming overflow, but the 'a' option forces it to display all target ports regardless of their current overflow consumption status."}
{"instruction": "When I run paint on a file, how does it differ from using a regular AQL list command?", "input": "Command: paint\nSyntax: paint file.reference {item.list*}{attr.list}{(options}\nDescription: The paint command displays items to the screen or printer in Update processor format. The paint command behaves differently than an AQL list command, in that controlling/dependent attributes are displayed as columns and rows. Also, attribute headers are boldfaced.", "output": "The paint command differs from AQL list commands in two key ways: (1) controlling/dependent attributes are displayed as columns and rows rather than in a linear format, and (2) attribute headers appear in boldface. Paint uses the Update processor format for display, making it more suitable for structured data presentation where relationships between attributes need to be clearly visible in a tabular layout."}
{"instruction": "What happens if I don't specify an attribute list when using the paint command?", "input": "Command: paint\nSyntax: paint file.reference {item.list*}{attr.list}{(options}\nParameters: attr.list - Indicates the names of the attributes that are affected by the command. Specific attributes can display, without using the default macro defined on the file's D-pointer. This option functions in the same way as the outlist in a list or sort command.", "output": "If you don't specify an attribute list, paint will use the default macro defined on the file's D-pointer (dictionary pointer). This means it will display the standard set of attributes that have been pre-configured for that file, similar to how the outlist works in list or sort commands. You can override this default behavior by explicitly specifying which attributes you want to display."}
{"instruction": "How can I include item-IDs in my paint output and send it directly to the printer?", "input": "Command: paint\nOptions: i - Includes the display of item-IDs, p - Outputs to the printer.\nExample: paint entity (i - Like the first example, but uses the i option to include the item-ID of each item.", "output": "Use the 'i' and 'p' options together: `paint filename (ip`. The 'i' option includes item-IDs in the display, while the 'p' option sends the output directly to the printer via the spooler. You can combine multiple options within the same parentheses."}
{"instruction": "Why would I need to use the pibstat command and what information does it provide?", "input": "Command: pibstat\nSyntax: pibstat value\nDescription: The pibstat command in the DM account displays the current PIB status bit settings for a specified value. The pibstat command is perhaps the most useful indication of resource use on a D3 machine. Common values include: f3xx (Waiting-for-input or displaying text), e3xx (Waiting-for-input with echo off), f5xx (Displaying text in xoff state), ffxx (Currently using CPU), bfxx (Currently sleeping), dfxx (Requesting disk I/O).", "output": "The pibstat command is one of the most useful tools for monitoring resource usage on a D3 machine. It decodes PIB (Process Information Block) status values that you get from the 'where' command. It tells you exactly what state a process is in - whether it's waiting for input (f3xx), actively using the CPU (ffxx), sleeping (bfxx), performing disk I/O (dfxx), or in other specific states. This is invaluable for diagnosing performance issues and understanding what processes are doing at any given moment."}
{"instruction": "Where do I get the value that I need to pass to the pibstat command?", "input": "Command: pibstat\nParameters: value - A 2-byte PIB status returned by the where command, under the column labeled PIB Stat.\nExample: Returns the PIB status for port 68 as ff10, which can then be used in the pibstat command: where 68 shows PIB Stat as ff10, then pibstat ff10 provides detailed status breakdown.", "output": "You get the value from the 'where' command output, specifically from the column labeled 'PIB Stat'. For example, if you run 'where 68' and see 'ff10' in the PIB Stat column, you would then run 'pibstat ff10' to get the detailed breakdown of what that status code means. The where command shows the current 2-byte PIB status that pibstat can then decode into human-readable information."}
{"instruction": "How do I find the UNIX process ID for a specific D3 port?", "input": "Command: pid\nSyntax: pid {port.number} {(options}\nDescription: The pid BASIC program displays the UNIX PID of a D3 process. The first form displays the UNIX PID or the specified D3 port number (PIB). For Windows: Not Supported", "output": "Use the pid command followed by the port number: `pid portnumber`. For example, `pid 22` will display the UNIX process ID for D3 port 22. If you run `pid` without any arguments, it will show the PID for the current process. Note that this command is not supported on Windows systems."}
{"instruction": "Can I check if specific UNIX processes are connected to the D3 virtual machine?", "input": "Command: pid\nSyntax: pid * {pid.to.search} {(options}\nDescription: The second form displays the UNIX PIDs of all the D3 processes currently connected to the virtual machine. If a list of PIDs to search is provided, a plus sign displays before each process found in the list. This form is useful to determine whether a specified UNIX process, identified by its PID, is connected to the virtual machine.", "output": "Yes, use `pid * pid1 pid2 ...` to search for specific UNIX processes. For example, `pid * 36978 2345` will show all D3 processes and mark with a plus sign (+) any processes from your search list that are connected to the virtual machine. Processes not connected won't have the plus sign. The current process is marked with an asterisk (*)."}
{"instruction": "What's the safest way to send commands to another port without interfering with what they're doing?", "input": "Command: poke\nDescription: The poke BASIC program sends either a string of characters, or one or more TCL commands to the input buffer of another port. This process does not check to see that the target port is ready to accept characters. In other words, if the target port is in the Update Processor or a FlashBASIC program at an input statement and the (TCL) who command is poked to the target port, it is treated as data on the receiving end.", "output": "The poke command doesn't check if the target port is ready to accept commands, so you need to be careful about timing. If the target port is in the Update Processor or at a FlashBASIC input statement, any commands you poke will be treated as data input rather than commands to execute. To use poke safely, ensure the target port is at a TCL prompt and ready to accept commands, or coordinate with the user on that port beforehand."}
{"instruction": "How can I execute multiple TCL commands on another port in sequence?", "input": "Command: poke\nSyntax: poke port.number tcl.commands esc{tcl.commands{esc}...}\nDescription: One or more TCL commands can be sent directly to the target port. Each TCL command must be followed by an escape, which is treated as a carriage return on the receiving port.\nExample: poke 16 who[time[ovf - pokes the who, time, and ovf commands to port 16 and executes them.", "output": "Send multiple TCL commands by separating each with an escape character (shown as [ in examples): `poke portnumber command1[command2[command3[`. For example, `poke 16 who[time[ovf[` will execute the who, time, and ovf commands in sequence on port 16. Each escape is treated as a carriage return on the receiving port, so the commands execute one after another."}
{"instruction": "Is there a way to execute TCL commands from a file on another port?", "input": "Command: poke\nDescription: An item containing one or more valid TCL commands can also be transmitted directly from a file. The transmitted item must contain one valid TCL command on each attribute. This feature is accomplished by poking an escape to the target port.\nExample: poke 16[md script1 - executes commands from the script1 item in the md file on port 16, where script1 contains: att 1: who, att 2: time, att 3: ovf", "output": "Yes, you can execute commands from a file item by using `poke portnumber[filename itemid[`. The item must contain one valid TCL command per attribute. For example, if you have an item called 'script1' in the 'md' file with commands in separate attributes, use `poke 16[md script1[` to execute all commands in sequence on port 16. Each attribute becomes a separate command line."}
{"instruction": "What precautions should I take before using the power-off command?", "input": "Command: power-off\nSyntax: power-off {(u}\nDescription: The power-off command in the DM account brings the system to an orderly shutdown by logging off all users, flushing memory to disk, and parking the disk heads prior to halting the system. If the port is not logged off by the time the power-off reaches its final phase, the port is automatically logged off.", "output": "Before using power-off, ensure you have proper authorization as this command will shut down the entire system. The command will systematically log off all users, flush all memory contents to disk, and halt the system. If you don't use the 'u' option, you'll be prompted to confirm logging off each active port individually. Make sure all critical work is saved and users are notified, as any ports not logged off will be forcibly logged off during the final shutdown phase."}
{"instruction": "How does the unconditional option work with power-off?", "input": "Command: power-off\nParameters: u - Unconditionally logs all ports off.\nExample: If any ports are still active without the u option, the system prompts: 'Line 1 is logged on as lw ts. Do you want to log it off (y/n/a)?' You can respond with 'y' to log off that port, 'n' to abort, or 'a' to log off all remaining ports.", "output": "The 'u' option (`power-off (u`) skips all confirmation prompts and automatically logs off all active ports without asking for permission. Without this option, power-off will prompt you for each active port asking if you want to log it off, giving you choices: 'y' (yes, log this port off), 'n' (no, abort the shutdown), or 'a' (automatically log off all remaining ports). The 'u' option essentially does what 'a' would do but without any prompting."}
{"instruction": "How do I respool a held print job with specific formatting options?", "input": "Command: pr-spool-job\nSyntax: pr-spool-job spooler.job{(options}\nDescription: The pr-spool-job command respools a spooler hold job. The user can select a one-time sp-assignment for this job by placing the desired sp-assign options after the open parenthesis at TCL.\nExample: pr-spool-job 3 (f2,4 - respools spooler job number 3 to form queue number 2. Four copies of the job will be output. Note that a comma is used to separate the form queue number 2 from the number of copies 4.", "output": "Use `pr-spool-job jobnumber (options` where options can include queue assignment and copy count. For example, `pr-spool-job 3 (f2,4` respools job #3 to form queue 2 with 4 copies. The 'f' option specifies the output queue (f2 = queue 2), and the number after the comma specifies copies. You can also use other sp-assign options like 'h' for hold, 's' to suppress printer output, or 'a' for alternate port output."}
{"instruction": "I need to find prime numbers around a specific value - how does this work?", "input": "Command: prime\nSyntax: prime {number}\nDescription: The prime BASIC program calculates the next higher and lower prime number from a specified number.\nExample: prime 13 outputs: '13 is a prime number, the next highest prime number is = 17, the next lowest prime number is = 11'", "output": "The prime command will tell you if your number is prime and show you the nearest prime numbers above and below it. For example, `prime 13` shows that 13 is prime, with 17 as the next higher prime and 11 as the next lower prime. If you give it a non-prime number like `prime 14`, it will show the next highest (17) and lowest (13) prime numbers. If you run `prime` without a number, it will prompt you to enter one."}
{"instruction": "How can I display error messages from the messages file in their proper format?", "input": "Command: print-err\nSyntax: print-err file.reference msg.list{(options)}\nDescription: The print-err command provides a means of displaying messages from the messages file in their output format.\nParameters: file.reference - Name of the file, usually messages, that contains the message list. msg.list - Indicates one or more item-IDs of items in the messages file.\nExample: print-err messages 3 outputs '[3] The command 'A' is not defined.'", "output": "Use `print-err filename message-id` to display formatted error messages. For example, `print-err messages 3` displays message #3 in its proper format with message number prefix. You can specify multiple message IDs and use options like 'p' to send output to printer or 'n' to suppress page pauses. Messages are typically stored in the 'dm,messages,' file, but you can specify any file containing properly formatted message items."}
{"instruction": "Can I capture the output of UNIX commands into D3 items for further processing?", "input": "Command: psh\nSyntax: psh unix.command{~}>{>} {file} item{(t}\nDescription: The psh BASIC program executes a UNIX command and captures the results in a D3 item. This command is an alternative to the ! command, which allows capturing the result of the UNIX command into a D3 item. For Windows: Not Supported\nExample: psh cal 2003 > tmp 2003 - prints a calendar for 2003 and stores it in item 2003 in file tmp.", "output": "Yes, use the psh command: `psh unix-command > file item`. For example, `psh cal 2003 > tmp 2003` executes the UNIX cal command for year 2003 and stores the output in item '2003' in the 'tmp' file. If you don't specify a file, it defaults to 'lst'. Use '>>' to append to existing items, and add '(t' option to display results on screen while storing them. Note that this command is not supported on Windows systems."}
{"instruction": "How do I handle error output when capturing UNIX command results?", "input": "Command: psh\nExample: psh cat /usr/D3/myfile 2>&1 ~> myfile - transfers the file, and stderr is redirected to stdout ('2>&1'). Therefore, if the file does not exist, the error message is in the D3 item. Note the escape of the > D3 redirection.", "output": "To capture both standard output and error messages, use '2>&1' to redirect stderr to stdout, and escape the D3 redirection with '~': `psh command 2>&1 ~> item`. For example, `psh cat /usr/D3/myfile 2>&1 ~> myfile` will capture both the file contents and any error messages (like 'file not found') into the D3 item. The tilde (~) before the > is necessary to escape the D3 redirection when the UNIX command also uses redirection."}
{"instruction": "What's the best way to monitor system processes and identify performance issues?", "input": "Command: psr\nSyntax: psr {port.number} {(options}\nDescription: The psr BASIC program displays formatted output of the status of the currently active UNIX and/or D3 processes. For Windows: Not Supported\nOptions: r - Shows only the running processes, s{n} - Selects running processes by doing two UNIX ps commands separated by sampling period (default 1s), k - Shows only processes running in D3", "output": "Use `psr (r` to see only running processes, which helps identify active processes that might be consuming resources. For more detailed performance analysis, use `psr (s3` to sample processes over a 3-second interval and show CPU time accumulated during that period. Processes showing significant CPU time (like '+3' meaning 3 seconds in a 3-second sample) may indicate performance problems or infinite loops. The 'k' option shows only D3 processes if you want to focus on database-related activity."}
{"instruction": "How can I identify all child processes spawned by a specific D3 process?", "input": "Command: psr\nDescription: If the port number is specified, the output shows process information related to the D3 process port and its child processes. This argument supersedes the r and k options. The form psr port.number is useful to identify all processes spawned by a D3 process.", "output": "Specify the port number directly: `psr portnumber`. For example, `psr 5` will show the process information for D3 port 5 and all of its child processes. This is particularly useful for troubleshooting when a D3 process has spawned multiple UNIX processes and you need to see the complete process tree associated with that specific port."}
{"instruction": "How does qselect differ from get-list when creating lists from file data?", "input": "Command: qselect\nSyntax: qselect file.reference {itemlist*} {(attribute.number)}\nDescription: The qselect command creates a list from the specified file reference and item list, similar to the get-list command. The list is constructed from the attributes identified by the attribute number in an item (or list of items) specified by the item list. Each attribute, value, and sub-value becomes a single attribute value in the list.", "output": "While qselect is similar to get-list, it specifically extracts data from particular attributes within items to create the list. With qselect, you can specify an attribute number to extract only that attribute's contents from the specified items, and each attribute value, multi-value, and sub-value becomes a separate entry in the resulting list. This gives you more granular control over list creation compared to get-list which typically works with entire items or item-IDs."}
{"instruction": "Can I reset communication settings for specific ports back to default values?", "input": "Command: :reset-async\nSyntax: :reset-async {port.number}\nDescription: The :reset-async BASIC program resets the current port or all ports to default values. For Windows: Not Supported. If the port number is omitted, all ports are reset. The default values are: converse, tandem, and mirror, all off, yet enabled for use.", "output": "Yes, use `:reset-async portnumber` to reset a specific port to default communication settings. For example, `:reset-async 5` resets only port 5. If you omit the port number (`:reset-async`), all ports are reset. The default settings turn off converse, tandem, and mirror modes but keep them enabled for future use. This command is not supported on Windows systems."}
{"instruction": "I accidentally deleted an item in the Update processor - can I get it back?", "input": "Command: recover-item\nSyntax: recover-item\nDescription: The recover-item command recovers the last item deleted by the CTRL+XO command in the Update processor. It also recovers the last item that was exited without filing. The process first displays the name of the item to be recovered. The deleted item is stored in a temporary buffer and can be recovered until another item is deleted.", "output": "Yes, use the `recover-item` command immediately after the deletion. It can recover the last item deleted with CTRL+XO or the last item you exited without filing. The command will show you the name of the item it can recover and ask for confirmation. However, the deleted item is stored in a temporary buffer, so you can only recover the most recent deletion - once you delete another item, the previous one is lost forever."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between renaming a complete file versus just its dictionary or data portion?", "input": "Command: rename\nSyntax: RENAME [(DICT/DATA)] old-filename TO: new-filename\nDescription: The rename command renames both the dictionary and data portions of the file. It can also be used to rename only the dictionary or data portions of the file by specifying DICT or DATA in the command line. The rename command cannot be used to transfer files between the dictionary and data levels.", "output": "By default, `RENAME old-filename TO: new-filename` renames both the dictionary and data portions together. However, you can rename just one portion by specifying either `RENAME (DICT) old-filename TO: new-filename` for dictionary only, or `RENAME (DATA) old-filename TO: new-filename` for data only. Note that you cannot use rename to move files between dictionary and data levels - it only renames within the same level. The command also sets all group update flags for proper incremental save functionality."}
{"instruction": "How do I change the name of a file in the D3 system?", "input": "Syntax: rename-file file.reference\nnew name: new.file.reference\n\nDescription: The rename-file BASIC program changes the name of a file, both in the master dictionary and in the dictionary of the designated file reference. The process prompts for the new name. Items within the file and its associated dictionary are not affected.", "output": "Use the rename-file command followed by the current file reference. The system will prompt you for the new name. The syntax is:\n\nrename-file file.reference\nnew name: new.file.reference\n\nThis command changes the file name in both the master dictionary and the file's dictionary, but items within the file remain unchanged."}
{"instruction": "What happens to the items inside a file when I use rename-file?", "input": "Description: The rename-file BASIC program changes the name of a file, both in the master dictionary and in the dictionary of the designated file reference. The process prompts for the new name. Items within the file and its associated dictionary are not affected.", "output": "Items within the file and its associated dictionary are not affected when you use rename-file. The command only changes the file name in the master dictionary and the designated file reference dictionary, but all the data items remain unchanged."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to rename a file from test1 to test2", "input": "Example: rename-file test1new name:test2", "output": "Here's how to rename a file from test1 to test2:\n\nrename-file test1\nnew name:test2\n\nThe command will change the file name from test1 to test2 in both the master dictionary and the file's dictionary."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to restart suspended output on a specific port in D3?", "input": "Syntax: reset-port port.number{(options}\nreset-port tty.name{(options}\n\nDescription: The reset-port BASIC program restarts suspended output and drains both the input and output terminal buffers. For Windows: Not Supported", "output": "Yes, you can restart suspended output using the reset-port command. The syntax is:\n\nreset-port port.number{(options}\nreset-port tty.name{(options}\n\nThis command restarts suspended output and drains both input and output terminal buffers. Note that this command is not supported on Windows systems."}
{"instruction": "When would I need to use the reset-port command with different options?", "input": "Parameters: port.number - PIB associated to the device to restart. This command may not be issued against its own port. tty.name - Device name to reset. Options: f - Suspends output option acts as if the device had sent an x-off(CTRL+S). i - Drains input buffer. n - Restarts output and acts as if the device had sent an x-on(CTRL+Q). o - Drains output buffer. r - Resets to raw mode.", "output": "You would use different reset-port options based on your specific needs:\n\n- Use 'f' option to suspend output (like CTRL+S)\n- Use 'i' option to drain the input buffer and remove waiting characters\n- Use 'n' option to restart output (like CTRL+Q) \n- Use 'o' option to drain the output buffer and remove characters waiting to be sent\n- Use 'r' option to reset the device to raw mode\n\nIf no options are specified, the command defaults to using 'i', 'n', and 'o' options together."}
{"instruction": "How do I reset port 25 and what does it accomplish?", "input": "Example: reset-port 25\nExample: reset-port /dev/tty26", "output": "To reset port 25, use:\n\nreset-port 25\n\nThis accomplishes several things:\n- Restarts any suspended output on the port\n- Drains the input buffer (removes characters waiting to be read)\n- Drains the output buffer (removes characters waiting to be sent)\n- Restarts output as if an x-on command was sent\n\nThis is useful when a port is stopped by an x-off command that was never followed by x-on."}
{"instruction": "Can I resize a D3 file while other users are accessing it?", "input": "Description: The resize command allows a file to be read or modified while the items are being rehashed. When a resizing command has begun rehashing a file, the command can be logged-off or interrupted without problems. The resizing process can then be restarted on the same line or on a phantom.", "output": "Yes, the resize command allows a file to be read or modified while items are being rehashed. The resizing process is designed to be non-blocking, so users can continue accessing the file during the operation. If the resize process is interrupted or you log off, it can be restarted later on the same line or on a phantom process."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between resizing up versus down in D3?", "input": "Description: When resizing downwards, it is sometimes not possible to release the extra file space if another user has that file open. In this case, all users must close the file before the space can be released. When all users have closed the file, re-execute the resize command to release the space.", "output": "When resizing up (increasing file size), the process typically completes without issues. However, when resizing down (decreasing file size), you may encounter a limitation: if other users have the file open, the extra file space cannot be released immediately. In this case, all users must close the file before the space can be freed. Once all users have closed the file, you need to re-execute the resize command to actually release the unused space."}

{"instruction": "How can I minimize the performance impact when resizing a large file?", "input": "Parameters: w{n} - Waits after every group. If a numeric parameter is not specified, then this option causes the resizing process to wait for approximately 100 milliseconds between each group that it rehashes. If an optional numeric parameter is specified, then the process sleeps for n seconds between each group. This option minimizes the impact on overall system performance during the resizing process and is strongly recommended.", "output": "Use the 'w' option to minimize performance impact during resizing:\n\nresize filename modulo (w)\n\nThis makes the process wait approximately 100 milliseconds between each group it rehashes. You can also specify a custom wait time:\n\nresize filename modulo (w5)\n\nThis would wait 5 seconds between each group. The 'w' option is strongly recommended as it minimizes the impact on overall system performance during the resizing process."}
{"instruction": "When should I use restore-accounts versus account-restore?", "input": "Description: The restore-accounts BASIC program restores all accounts that do not already exist on the system from the attached file-save tape or a tape created by an account-save with an active list of accounts. restore-accounts uses account-restore (az) in its processing loop.", "output": "Use restore-accounts when you need to restore multiple accounts that don't already exist on the system from a file-save tape or account-save tape with an active list. The restore-accounts command automatically processes all accounts on the tape using account-restore in its processing loop. Use account-restore directly when you need to restore a single specific account or want more control over the restore process for individual accounts."}
{"instruction": "What happens if I try to restore accounts that already exist on the system?", "input": "Description: The restore-accounts BASIC program restores all accounts that do not already exist on the system from the attached file-save tape or a tape created by an account-save with an active list of accounts.", "output": "The restore-accounts command only restores accounts that do not already exist on the system. If an account with the same name already exists, it will be skipped during the restore process. This prevents accidental overwriting of existing accounts and their data."}
{"instruction": "How do I restore accounts from a tape created on a different system with different frame sizes?", "input": "Parameters: frame.size - Integer number that designates the frame size of the source system, which created save media. Specifying a frame size automatically enables the f option, which has the effect of disabling fast restores. This option automatically affects modulos, which are either divided or multiplied by the specified number, according to the data frame size on the target machine.", "output": "Specify the source system's frame size as a parameter:\n\nrestore-accounts (frame.size)\n\nFor example, if the source system had 500-byte frames:\nrestore-accounts (500)\n\nThis automatically adjusts the modulos based on the frame size difference between source and target systems. If your target system has larger frames than the source, modulos will be divided by the ratio. The frame size option automatically disables fast restores to ensure proper data conversion."}
{"instruction": "How do I execute multiple BASIC programs in sequence automatically?", "input": "Syntax: run-list file.reference\n\nDescription: The run-list BASIC program runs a series of BASIC programs. As each one concludes, the next program is automatically executed. An active list of BASIC programs must be present, before invoking this command.", "output": "Use the run-list command with an active list of BASIC programs. First create a select list of the programs you want to run, then execute:\n\nrun-list file.reference\n\nEach program will run automatically in sequence. You must have an active list of BASIC programs before invoking this command."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to set up and run three programs sequentially", "input": "Example: select bp program1 program2 program3\n[404] 3 items selected out of 127 items.\nrun-list bp", "output": "Here's how to run three programs sequentially:\n\n1. First, create a select list of the programs:\nselect bp program1 program2 program3\n[404] 3 items selected out of 127 items.\n\n2. Then execute the run-list command:\nrun-list bp\n\nThe programs will now run automatically one after another in the order specified."}
{"instruction": "What's the purpose of the s-dump command and when would I use it?", "input": "Description: The s-dump command writes items from a given file to the attached peripheral storage device in sorted order. The heading or header modifier allows specifying the contents of the tape label written to the tape prior to the dump. The tape must already be at load point in order to write the tape label. If no selection criteria are specified, the entire file is written.", "output": "The s-dump command is used to write file items to peripheral storage (like tape) in sorted order. You would use it for:\n\n- Creating sorted backups of file data\n- Archiving data with custom tape labels\n- Selective dumps based on criteria\n- Creating organized data exports\n\nThe tape must be positioned at load point before running the command. If you don't specify selection criteria, the entire file will be dumped in sorted order."}

{"instruction": "Why would I want to create a sample of items instead of processing the entire file?", "input": "Description: The sample command creates a temporary select-list of the first n items in a file that match the specified criteria. This command is useful when testing a small number of items. For example, testing 100 items in a file rather than the entire file.", "output": "You would use the sample command to create a subset for testing purposes. This is particularly useful when:\n\n- Testing queries or reports on large files where processing all items would be time-consuming\n- Debugging programs with a manageable dataset\n- Validating selection criteria before running against the full file\n- Performance testing with a controlled sample size\n\nFor example, testing with 100 items instead of processing a file with millions of records saves significant time during development and testing phases."}
{"instruction": "How do I create a sample of the first 4 orders from January 15, 2018?", "input": "Example: The following example creates a select-list containing the first four items in the ORDERS file whose sale date is January 15, 2018:\n>SAMPLE ORDERS WITH DATE = \"01/15/18\" (4)\n4 ITEMS SELECTED.\nIf you list these items with the list command, they appear in sorted order:\n>LIST ORDERS\n0179\n0134\n0234\n0156\n4 ITEMS LISTED.", "output": "Use this command to sample the first 4 orders from January 15, 2018:\n\nSAMPLE ORDERS WITH DATE = \"01/15/18\" (4)\n\nThe system will respond:\n4 ITEMS SELECTED.\n\nYou can then list these items:\nLIST ORDERS\n\nThe results will show the item IDs in sorted order:\n0179\n0134\n0234\n0156\n4 ITEMS LISTED."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between the various save options in D3?", "input": "Description: The save command invokes the backup procedure to save the entire file system, an individual account, or to perform an incremental save. These types of saves can be performed: A full file-save is a complete logical backup of the D3 file system. An incremental file-save saves only those items which have changed since the last full file-save. An account-save saves all the files in a single account. An incremental account-save is like an incremental file-save, but only affects the files in a single account.", "output": "D3 offers several save types:\n\n1. **Full file-save**: Complete backup of the entire D3 file system\n2. **Incremental file-save**: Saves only items changed since the last full file-save (system-wide)\n3. **Account-save**: Saves all files within a single account only\n4. **Incremental account-save**: Saves only changed items within a single account since the last full save\n\nIncremental saves are faster and use less storage but require a full save as a baseline. Account saves are useful for backing up specific accounts without affecting the entire system."}
{"instruction": "How do I perform a save that includes B-tree indexes?", "input": "Parameters: b - Saves the B-tree indexes. After a full-restore, this prevents having to regenerate indexes. Note that this option is only supported for UNIX and Windows VME implementations. It is not supported from the Windows FSI. Warning: Saved indexes are platform specific and will not be restored properly on platforms differing from the originator.", "output": "Use the 'b' option to save B-tree indexes:\n\nsave (bt)\n\nThis saves the B-tree indexes along with the data, preventing the need to regenerate indexes after a full-restore. Important warnings:\n- Only supported on UNIX and Windows VME (not Windows FSI)\n- Indexes are platform-specific and won't restore properly on different platforms\n- Must be combined with the 't' option to actually write to tape"}
{"instruction": "What does it mean when save shows hierarchical versus indented format?", "input": "Parameters: q - Changes the terminal display from hierarchical format to indented format.", "output": "The save command normally displays file information in hierarchical format during the backup process. Using the 'q' option changes this to indented format, which presents the same information but with a different visual layout. The indented format may be easier to read as it shows the relationship between accounts, dictionaries, and data files through indentation levels rather than hierarchical tree structures."}
{"instruction": "How can I save a select-list permanently for later use?", "input": "Description: The save-list command writes the list of item-IDs generated by a select, sselect, qselect, or get-list command. Parameters: save-list Must be invoked immediately after the command that created the list. file.reference Specifies a file in which to save the list. If not specified, the list is saved in the pointer-file. list.name Specifies the name of the list-item.", "output": "Use the save-list command immediately after creating a select-list:\n\nsave-list {file.reference} {list.name}\n\nFor example:\nselect customers with state = \"CA\"\nsave-list customer-file ca-customers\n\nThis saves the list in the specified file with the given name. If you don't specify a file, it saves to the pointer-file. If you don't specify a name, it uses your user-ID as the default name."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to create and save a list of entities in Orange County", "input": "Example: sselect entity with area.code \"714\" by name\n[404] 16782 items selected out of 272876 items.\nsave-list orange.county\nList 'orange.county' in 'pointer-file' saved.", "output": "Here's how to create and save a list of entities in Orange County:\n\n1. First, create the select-list:\nsselect entity with area.code \"714\" by name\n[404] 16782 items selected out of 272876 items.\n\n2. Then save the list:\nsave-list orange.county\nList 'orange.county' in 'pointer-file' saved.\n\nThe list is now permanently saved and can be retrieved later with the get-list command."}
{"instruction": "How do I search for specific text strings across all attributes in a file?", "input": "Description: The search command searches a file for the existence of one or more strings of characters in any attribute and optionally creates and saves a list.", "output": "Use the search command followed by the file reference:\n\nsearch file.reference\n\nThe system will prompt \"search for:\" where you can enter one or more text strings. The command searches across all attributes in the file for these strings and can optionally create a list of matching items. You can specify multiple search strings by entering them one at a time at the prompt."}
{"instruction": "What options are available when I want to see more context around search matches?", "input": "Parameters: u - Outputs two attributes after, and one line before, the matching line.", "output": "Use the 'u' option to see more context around your search matches:\n\nsearch filename (u)\n\nThis option outputs:\n- One line before the matching line\n- The matching line itself  \n- Two attributes after the matching line\n\nThis gives you better context to understand where and how your search terms appear in the data."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to search for 'vb' in the master dictionary and save the results", "input": "Example: The following example searches for vb in the master dictionary and saves the list as vb.list after completing.\nsearch md (l\nsearch for:vb\nsearch for:\nlist name:vb.list\n...\n[2000] 15 out of 1512 item(s) found.", "output": "Here's how to search for 'vb' in the master dictionary and save the results:\n\n1.

{"instruction": "How would I change the tape block size for an 8mm tape?", "input": "Command: set-device\nOptions: c - Changes the 8 mm tape block size. The current tape block size displays and the operator is prompted for the new block size (0 or 512).\nNote: For UNIX: The default block size is set at 0 at install time. A block size of 0 means variable length.", "output": "Use the 'c' option with set-device to change 8mm tape block size. The system will display the current block size and prompt you to enter a new size (either 0 for variable length or 512 for fixed length). On UNIX systems, the default is 0 (variable length) at installation."}
{"instruction": "Under what conditions does set-dozens affect numeric conversions?", "input": "Command: set-dozens\nDescription: The set-dozens command designates that a numeric expression of 1 is equal to 12 units.\nExample: Input 36 becomes 3, Input 5 becomes 60 (since 3 dozen = 36, and 5 dozen = 60)", "output": "The set-dozens command implements a dozens-based numbering system where 1 equals 12 units. In the example, input 36 converts to 3 (36÷12=3 dozen), and input 5 converts to 60 (5×12=60 units). This is useful for calculations involving dozens as the base unit."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to make dozens conversion the system default?", "input": "Command: set-dozens\nParameters: options - u Sets system default.", "output": "Yes, you can make dozens conversion the system default by using 'set-dozens (u'. This sets the dozens-based numeric conversion as the default for the entire system."}
{"instruction": "How do I modify file attributes for multiple files using set-dptr?", "input": "Command: set-dptr\nSyntax: set-dptr {[+|-]types} {item.list} {(options}\nExample: set-dptr +p bp (f - Sets the p type to all data levels of the file bp\nOptions: f - Changes files, a - Changes accounts", "output": "Use 'set-dptr +p bp (f' to add the 'p' attribute to all data levels of file 'bp'. The '+' adds attributes, '-' removes them. Use (f) option for files or (a) for accounts. You can specify multiple attributes like '+x -l' to add 'x' type and remove 'l' type simultaneously."}
{"instruction": "What safety considerations should I keep in mind when using set-dptr?", "input": "Command: set-dptr\nWarning: The set-dptr command will not affect processes that currently have the file open. Those processes must either close the file or logoff for the change to take affect. Do NOT use the set-dptr command to add the X option to FSI accounts using the set-dptr (A option as this negatively affects the restore-accounts command.", "output": "Important safety considerations: 1) Changes won't affect processes with files currently open - those processes must close files or logoff. 2) Never add the X option to FSI accounts using set-dptr (A, as this will break the restore-accounts command. 3) File sensitivity cannot be changed after creation. Always ensure file integrity when enabling logging (+l) by using the d option."}
{"instruction": "How would I remove xy types from all files in selected accounts?", "input": "Command: set-dptr\nExample: select mds\\nset-dptr -xy (a\nNote: It is not necessary to select items in the mds file, which are real D-pointers. set-dptr ignores Q-pointers and items that do not look like D-pointers.", "output": "First run 'select mds' to select all accounts, then use 'set-dptr -xy (a' to remove both 'x' and 'y' types from all files in all selected accounts. The command automatically ignores Q-pointers and non-D-pointer items, processing only actual file D-pointers."}
{"instruction": "How do I configure a custom ESC key for level pushing?", "input": "Command: set-esc\nSyntax: set-esc {argument} {(options}\nDescription: Specifies the value of the key to treat as the ESC key. This key subsequently pushes a level when pressed.\nExample: set-esc 3 - Defines the ESC key as CTRL+C", "output": "Use 'set-esc 3' to define CTRL+C as the ESC key for level pushing. You can specify the key by its decimal value, hexadecimal value, or use keywords like 'esc' for normal ESC (x'1B') or 'off' to disable (x'ff'). The configured key will push a TCL level when pressed."}
{"instruction": "Why does set-esc warn against unreasonable key assignments?", "input": "Command: set-esc\nWarning: Assigning an unreasonable value to the ESC key, such as ENTER, will have unpredictable results.", "output": "Assigning commonly used keys like ENTER to the ESC function causes unpredictable system behavior because those keys are needed for normal operation. If ENTER were assigned as the ESC key, every attempt to press ENTER would push a level instead of executing commands or confirming input, making the system unusable."}
{"instruction": "When should I use set-file instead of direct path names?", "input": "Command: set-file\nSyntax: set-file {account.name{file.name}} {alternate.name}\nDescription: Creates or updates the synonym-defining item called qfile in the master dictionary. Provides access to the specified file name in the specified account.name by using the file name, qfile, in place of the file name parameter.\nNote: The same functionality can be achieved using path names.", "output": "Use set-file when you want to create a convenient synonym 'qfile' for accessing files in other accounts without typing full path names repeatedly. While path names provide the same functionality, set-file creates a reusable shortcut. For example, 'set-file dm bp' lets you use 'qfile' instead of 'dm,bp' in subsequent commands."}
{"instruction": "What happens to previous Q-pointers when I run set-file?", "input": "Command: set-file\nNote: Each time set-file is invoked, it overwrites the previous Q-pointer.", "output": "Each execution of set-file overwrites the previous Q-pointer. This means you can only have one active qfile synonym at a time - creating a new one replaces the existing qfile definition in the master dictionary."}
{"instruction": "How do I attach a high-density 5.25-inch floppy drive?", "input": "Command: set-floppy\nSyntax: set-floppy {(density, drive)}\nExample: set-floppy (ah - Attaches the floppy disk drive A at high density\nOptions: h (High density - 1.2 MB for 5.25-inch), a (Selects 5.25-inch floppy disk)", "output": "Use 'set-floppy (ah' to attach a 5.25-inch floppy drive at high density (1.2 MB). The 'a' option selects 5.25-inch drives, and 'h' specifies high density. Remember to use t-rew to rewind before any read/write operations."}
{"instruction": "What limitations exist when selecting between multiple floppy drives?", "input": "Command: set-floppy\nDescription: This command does not allow selection among two devices of the same type. If two or more devices of the same type are present, the first one in the configuration file is selected.", "output": "The set-floppy command cannot distinguish between multiple drives of the same type - it will always select the first one listed in the configuration file. If you have two identical floppy drives and need to select a specific one, you'll need to use a different method or ensure the desired drive is listed first in the configuration."}
{"instruction": "How would I configure the system flush periods for optimal performance?", "input": "Command: set-flush\nSyntax: set-flush {{period}{,force.period}} {(options}\nDescription: Displays or changes the value of the period of the flush and of the forced flush.\nExample: set-flush 30,off - Sets normal flush period to 30 seconds and disables forced flush", "output": "Use 'set-flush 30,off' to set the normal flush period to 30 seconds and disable forced flush. The first parameter (30) controls how often dirty frames are written to disk (0.5-32 seconds range). The second parameter controls forced flush: use 'off' or -1 to disable, 'imm' or 0 for immediate, or a number for guaranteed write time."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between normal flush and forced flush?", "input": "Command: set-flush\nParameters: period - flush process wakes up automatically to write dirty frames back to disk. force.period - flush process wakes up automatically to write all buffers containing data belonging to the file system. This period is the guaranteed time after which an update to a protected file is written to disk.", "output": "Normal flush writes only dirty (modified) frames back to disk at regular intervals. Forced flush writes ALL file system buffers and provides a guaranteed maximum time for protected file updates to reach disk. Normal flush is for general performance, while forced flush ensures data integrity by guaranteeing write completion within a specified timeframe."}
{"instruction": "How do I set up keyboard input translation for an IBM 3151 terminal?", "input": "Command: set-imap\nSyntax: set-imap {item-ID{time.out}} {(options}\nDescription: Defines a keyboard input and/or terminal output translation table\nExample: set-imap ibm3151 - Sets the keyboard translation to an ibm3151", "output": "Use 'set-imap ibm3151' to set up keyboard translation for an IBM 3151 terminal. This loads the translation table from the 'ibm3151' item in the keyboards file in the dm account, enabling proper interpretation of special key sequences like function keys and cursor movements for that terminal type."}
{"instruction": "Why is timeout adjustment important for keyboard translation?", "input": "Command: set-imap\nParameter: time.out - Value expressed in milliseconds, after which an incomplete input sequence is aborted. Should be adjusted to the baud rate and possible special conditions, such as network delays, to detect sequences of characters properly.\nCaution: If network conditions create large delays between characters, it might be necessary to set a larger time-out value.", "output": "Timeout adjustment is crucial because keyboard sequences (like ESC-[-A for cursor up) must be received within the timeout period to be recognized as single keystrokes. Network delays or slow connections can break sequences if timeout is too short. Set longer timeouts for network connections, but be aware this may cause individual keys like ESC to be misinterpreted as sequence starts."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I disable keyboard translation?", "input": "Command: set-imap\nDescription: If there is no argument, the translation mechanism, if currently active, is disabled.\nExample: set-imap - Disables the keyboard input translation", "output": "Running 'set-imap' without arguments disables the currently active keyboard translation mechanism. The terminal will revert to sending raw character codes without any translation, which means special key sequences may not work properly with applications expecting translated input."}
{"instruction": "How do I compile a modified keyboard translation item?", "input": "Command: set-imap\nOptions: c - Compiles the item. This option must be used when the item is modified. The item is compiled into a binary item and stored in the dictionary of the keyboards file.\nExample: set-imap att605 (c - Sets keyboard translation to att605, recompiling the item first", "output": "Use 'set-imap att605 (c' to recompile and load the att605 keyboard translation. The 'c' option is required whenever you modify a keyboard item - it compiles the item into binary format and stores it in the keyboards file dictionary. Without recompiling, changes to the source item won't take effect."}
{"instruction": "How would I set up character translation for port 5 using a numeric keyboard map?", "input": "Command: set-iomap\nSyntax: set-iomap port.number{,item-ID} ([i|o|ri|ro]\nDescription: Allows translatable input and output for each port on the system\nParameters: port.number - number of the port, item-ID - numeric user-defined keyboard item", "output": "Use 'set-iomap 5,12345 (i' to set up input character translation for port 5 using keyboard item 12345. The item-ID must be numeric and exist in the iomap-file in the dm account. Use (i) for input translation, (o) for output translation, or both. The keyboard item should contain ASCII translation mappings in the specified 34-attribute format."}
{"instruction": "What's the structure of an iomap keyboard item?", "input": "Command: set-iomap\nKeyboard item format: attr 0 - Item-ID, attr 1 - User comments, attr 2 to 33 - ASCII code of characters from 0 to 127 in ASCII hexadecimal format. Each attribute has exactly eight entries, each entry must be two characters.\nExample: To translate character A to B: ASCII A is x'41' = d'65', ASCII B is x'42' = d'66', 65 mod 8 = 8 remainder 1, so B goes in attribute 10 at column 3 as '42'", "output": "An iomap keyboard item has 34 attributes: attr 0 (Item-ID), attr 1 (comments), and attrs 2-33 (character mappings). Each mapping attribute contains exactly 8 two-character hexadecimal entries representing ASCII codes 0-127. To map character A(65) to B(66): calculate 65÷8=8 remainder 1, so place '42' (hex for B) in attribute 10 (8+2) at position 3 (1×2+1)."}
{"instruction": "How do I remove input translation from a specific port?", "input": "Command: set-iomap\nOptions: ri or ir - Removes an installed input keyboard, ro or or - Removes an installed output keyboard", "output": "Use 'set-iomap 5 (ri' to remove input keyboard translation from port 5, or 'set-iomap 5 (ro' to remove output translation. The 'ri' and 'ir' options are equivalent for removing input translation, and 'ro' and 'or' are equivalent for removing output translation."}

(Y/N)' - press Y to confirm removal. This will delete the encrypted password from attribute 3 of the hosts file."}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of overflow ID signatures?", "input": "Command: set-overflow-id\nSyntax: set-overflow-id {(options}\nDescription: Toggles the overflow ID signature on and off.\nOptions: n - Enables the overflow ID signature, f - Disables the overflow ID signature", "output": "Overflow ID signatures are used for tracking file system overflow conditions. Use 'set-overflow-id (n' to enable or 'set-overflow-id (f' to disable these signatures. When enabled, the system marks overflow conditions which can be observed using commands like 'dump <fid> li' to examine file integrity and overflow status."}
{"instruction": "How can I observe the effects of overflow ID markings?", "input": "Command: set-overflow-id\nExample: set-overflow-id (n\\ncreate-file dum 1 1\\nobserve fid\\ndump <fid> li\nThen: set-overflow-id (f\\ndelete-file dum\\ndump <fid> li", "output": "Enable overflow ID with 'set-overflow-id (n', create a test file, and use 'dump <fid> li' to observe the markings. Then disable with 'set-overflow-id (f', delete the file, and dump again to see that the overflow ID markings should remain unchanged, demonstrating how the signature system tracks overflow conditions."}
{"instruction": "How would I configure the local overflow cache settings for my current session?", "input": "The set-ovf-local command sets and displays the local overflow cache size. Syntax: set-ovf-local {ws.max}{,fs.max} {(options}. Parameters: ws.max sets the maximum workspace cache size, fs.max sets the maximum file space cache size. Options include: c (puts scrub pattern into local overflow frames), f (flushes all caches), g (copies current maximum cache settings into global default), s (suppresses display), x (disables local overflow scrubbing).", "output": "Use the set-ovf-local command to configure local overflow cache settings. To set specific cache sizes, specify ws.max for workspace cache and fs.max for file space cache. For example, 'set-ovf-local 100,300 (s' sets workspace cache to 100 and file space cache to 300 while suppressing display. Without parameters, it displays current cache status showing current and maximum values for both workspace and file space caches."}
{"instruction": "What happens when I run set-ovf-local without any parameters?", "input": "When specified without any options, the set-ovf-local command displays the cache status for the current line. The display shows a 2 by 2 grid of numbers. Example: set-ovf-local Private Overflow Cache Status: Current Max WS 2 20 File 10 30. This shows there are currently two workspace frames in the overflow cache with a maximum capacity of 20 frames, and 10 file space frames in the overflow cache with maximum capacity of 30 frames.", "output": "When run without parameters, set-ovf-local displays the current cache status in a 2x2 grid format showing Current and Max values for both WS (workspace) and File (file space) caches. For example, it might show WS has 2 current frames with max of 20, and File has 10 current frames with max of 30, indicating your current overflow cache utilization and limits."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to make my overflow cache settings the global default for all new users?", "input": "The set-ovf-local command options include: g - Copies the current maximum cache settings into the global default. Whenever a new user logs on, they automatically acquire this default value. Note: The global defaults are automatically preset to a factory specified value upon reboot, so if a permanent global change is desired, the user should place the set-ovf-local command in the system-coldstart macro.", "output": "Yes, use the 'g' option with set-ovf-local to copy your current cache settings to the global default. For example, 'set-ovf-local 100,300 (sg' sets cache sizes and makes them the global default. However, these settings reset to factory defaults on reboot, so for permanent changes, add the set-ovf-local command to the system-coldstart macro in dm."}
{"instruction": "When should I flush my local overflow caches?", "input": "The set-ovf-local command option 'f' flushes all caches. All frames held within the current cache are released back to the main table. Note: This operation is automatically invoked when the maximum values are changed. The act of logging off the system automatically flushes all local overflow caches.", "output": "Flush local overflow caches using the 'f' option when you need to release all cached frames back to the main table immediately. This happens automatically when you change maximum values or log off the system. Use 'set-ovf-local (fs' to flush all caches manually, which can be useful for freeing up memory or ensuring fresh cache state."}
{"instruction": "How do I set aside frames as reserve overflow in case the overflow table runs out?", "input": "The set-ovf-reserve command in the DM account, sets aside a specific number of frames as the spare tank in the event that the overflow table runs out of frames. The default is 1024 or .5% of your available disk space (maxfid), whichever is greater. Syntax: set-ovf-reserve {(reserve.quantity)} {(options}. Parameter: reserve.quantity - Number of frames to set aside as reserve overflow. Options: q - Suppresses messages.", "output": "Use the set-ovf-reserve command in the DM account to set aside reserve overflow frames. Specify the number of frames in parentheses, like 'set-ovf-reserve (1024)' to reserve 1024 frames. The system defaults to 1024 frames or 0.5% of available disk space, whichever is greater. Add the 'q' option to suppress confirmation messages."}
{"instruction": "What output should I expect when changing the overflow reserve setting?", "input": "When the set-ovf-reserve command is run, the system displays both the old and new reserve values. Example: If your overflow reserve is set to 200, running the command 'set-ovf-reserve (1024)' produces the message 'Previous reserve: 200 New reserve: 1024'.", "output": "The set-ovf-reserve command displays both the previous and new reserve values when executed. For example, if you run 'set-ovf-reserve (1024)' and your current reserve was 200, you'll see: 'Previous reserve: 200 New reserve: 1024'. This confirms the change and shows you what the setting was before modification."}
{"instruction": "How would I configure communication settings for a specific serial port?", "input": "The set-port BASIC program displays or changes the communication speed and protocol for a specified port. Syntax: set-port [tty|port.number]{,baud,parity,stop.bits,word.length} {(options}. Parameters include: port.number (serial port number, -1 for current port), baud (110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200), parity (n/0 for none, o/1 for odd, e/2 for even, m for mark, s for space), stop.bits (1 or 2), word.length (7 or 8). If no options are entered, current port settings display. If any option is entered, then all options must be entered.", "output": "Use set-port with the port number followed by communication parameters. For example, 'set-port 1,9600,n,1,8' configures port 1 with 9600 baud, no parity, 1 stop bit, and 8-bit word length. You must specify all parameters when making changes. Use 'set-port -1' to configure the current port, or just 'set-port' to display current settings without changes."}
{"instruction": "Why does set-port require all communication parameters when making changes?", "input": "The set-port command parameters: If no options are entered, the current port settings display. If any option is entered, then all options must be entered. Legal baud rates are: 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, and 19200. Valid stop bits are 1 or 2. Valid word lengths are 7 or 8.", "output": "Set-port requires all communication parameters when making changes to ensure complete and consistent port configuration. This prevents partial configurations that could lead to communication errors. You must specify baud rate, parity, stop bits, and word length together, such as '9600,n,1,8' for 9600 baud, no parity, 1 stop bit, and 8-bit words, ensuring the port has a complete valid configuration."}
{"instruction": "Under what conditions would I need to use set-remote-user?", "input": "The set-remote-user BASIC program can be used to allow the local user to utilize a different user and/or password when connecting to a remote OSFI server which has been started with the 'a' option to force user/password authorization. When the client process attempts to open a file on a remote OSFI server which has been started with the 'a' option, the server refuses the request unless the passed user and password match a user and password present on that server. However, it is often not realistic for user names and/or passwords to be identical across different machines.", "output": "Use set-remote-user when connecting to remote OSFI servers that require authorization (started with 'a' option) and your local username/password differs from those on the remote server. This is common when user accounts aren't synchronized across machines. The command allows you to specify alternate credentials for remote connections, enabling file access when your local credentials don't match the remote server's user database."}
{"instruction": "How do I map my local user to a different remote user for server connections?", "input": "The third form allows the user to enter (or destroy if used with the k option) a mapping entry for the specified remote OSFI host. The program prompts for the remote user and password to be used on all future connections to that host. Example: set-remote-user macha Remote User: mark Remote Password: [blank]. This allows user mark access to open files on the macha server, with no password.", "output": "Use 'set-remote-user hostname' to create a mapping for a specific remote server. For example, 'set-remote-user macha' will prompt you for the remote username and password to use when connecting to the 'macha' server. You can specify a different username like 'mark' and leave the password blank if none is required. This mapping applies to all future connections to that host."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between turning runaway autoquit on locally versus globally?", "input": "The set-runaway-autoquit command automatically terminates the specified process in the event of an overflow runaway condition. Parameters: n (turns feature on), f (turns feature off), l (local - applies to only the line from which command is executed), pib.num (applies to only the specified line). If neither pib.num or l option is specified, the command is applied to the global default. Examples: 'set-runaway-autoquit (n l' turns autoquit on for current line, 'set-runaway-autoquit (n' turns autoquit on for all lines with global limit.", "output": "Local (l option) applies runaway autoquit only to your current line/session, while global (no l option) sets the default for all lines system-wide. Use 'set-runaway-autoquit (n l' for local-only protection on your current session, or 'set-runaway-autoquit (n' to enable autoquit globally for all users. You can also target specific lines using the pib.num parameter instead of 'l'."}
{"instruction": "How would I establish a frame limit to prevent overflow runaway conditions?", "input": "The set-runaway-limit command establishes the maximum number of frames allowed before an overflow runaway condition occurs. If the number of frames acquired by the specified process reaches the specified limit, the system detects an overflow runaway condition and reports it. Parameters: limit (maximum number of frames, 0 for no maximum), options include pib (sets limit on specified port), d (specifies default runaway limit of 7000), l (sets limit locally for current line), r (removes limit on current line). If no parameters are provided, the current limit displays.", "output": "Use set-runaway-limit with a frame count to establish overflow protection. For example, 'set-runaway-limit 5000' sets a global limit of 5000 frames. Use 'set-runaway-limit (dl' to set the default limit (7000) locally, or 'set-runaway-limit (r' to remove local limits and use the global setting. Setting the limit to 0 removes the maximum entirely."}
{"instruction": "Why might a process hit the runaway limit and what should I do?", "input": "CAUTION: If a process creates a very large item, or select list, it may hit the specified limit. The command has to be aborted, the limit changed, and the command restarted. The default is normally set to a value which should suit most configurations. All overflow runaway conditions are logged to the errors file.", "output": "A process may hit the runaway limit when creating very large items or select lists that exceed the frame threshold. When this happens, you must abort the current command, increase the limit using set-runaway-limit with a higher value, then restart your command. The system logs all runaway conditions to the errors file for monitoring. The default limit of 7000 frames usually accommodates normal operations."}
{"instruction": "How do I create a pseudo tape device for backup operations?", "input": "The set-tapefile command creates a dynamically defined pseudo tape. The set-tapefile command allows pseudo tape devices to be dynamically created. This assignment of a tape device is temporary and can be overwritten by performing another set-tapefile command to the same virtual tape device. The tape file is now ready for use as a tape unit until the system is shut down. Commands such as t-dump, account-restore, file-save, and so on, function in customary fashion. Syntax: set-tapefile <path>. Parameter: path - A valid path on the host operating system without requiring surrounding quotation marks.", "output": "Use set-tapefile followed by a file path to create a pseudo tape device. For example, 'set-tapefile C:\\ORDER ENTRY\\LOS ANGELES\\orders.d3p' creates a tape device pointing to that file location. The pseudo tape works with standard tape commands like t-dump, account-restore, and file-save until system shutdown. You can reassign the same virtual tape device by running set-tapefile again with a different path."}
{"instruction": "What's the purpose of the set-thousands and set-units commands?", "input": "The set-thousands command designates that a numeric expression of 1 is equal to 1000 units. The set-units command designates that a numeric expression of 1 is equal to 1 unit. Both commands have option 'u' to set the system default. Example with set-thousands: input of 3000 displays as 3, input of 5 displays as 5000. Example with set-units: input of 5 displays as 5 for both conversions (one-to-one correspondence).", "output": "Set-thousands and set-units control numeric scaling for unit conversions. Set-thousands makes 1 equal 1000 units, so 3000 displays as 3 and 5 becomes 5000. Set-units maintains one-to-one correspondence where 5 stays 5. These affect user exit conversions (u01b6 for input, u11b6 for output). Use the 'u' option with either command to make the setting a system default."}
{"instruction": "How do I terminate a shared printer process that's running with UNIX?", "input": "The shp-kill command terminates a D3 printer shared with UNIX and all the associated processes. Users who do not own the process and are not root, will not be able to kill the printer. Syntax: shp-kill number. Parameter: number - D3 printer number, as specified in the startshp command. This command executes 'sp-kill dprinter.number' and relies on log files created in /var/tmp/lppick by the startshp command. Example: shp-kill 0.", "output": "Use shp-kill followed by the printer number to terminate a shared D3 printer. For example, 'shp-kill 0' terminates printer 0. You must own the process or be root to kill it. The command automatically handles the D3 printer process, sends SIGTERM/SIGKILL to underlying processes, and terminates associated lppick filter processes. It only works with printers started by the startshp command."}
{"instruction": "What information does shp-status provide about shared printers?", "input": "The shp-status command displays status information about printers shared with UNIX, started by the startshp command. The display shows: VMname (virtual machine), Prt (printer number), Port, PID (process ID), Spooler command, and Status. Example output shows pick0 printer 0 on port 126 with PID 1763 using 'exec lp -onobanner' command with OK status. With the 't' option, trace information displays starting with newest entries.", "output": "Shp-status shows comprehensive printer status including virtual machine name, printer number, port, process ID, spooler command, and current status. It helps diagnose issues by showing whether printers are OK, if processes are dead, or if there are errors.

{"instruction": "Under what conditions should I run the shutdown command?", "input": "The shutdown BASIC program initiates an orderly system shutdown sequence, and should be executed before turning off or rebooting any D3 system. Critical files are checked for consistency, any user logged on is logged off, all process workspaces are released, all printers are stopped, all phantom jobs are logged off, and all updated memory frames are written to disk. The critical files checked include: mds,, dm,users, dm,, dm,pibs, dm,tcl-stack, dm,devices, dm,backgrounds. The macro user-shutdown on the dm account is executed if it exists.", "output": "Always run shutdown before turning off or rebooting any D3 system to ensure data integrity. The command performs critical cleanup: checks file consistency, logs off all users, releases workspaces, stops printers, terminates phantom jobs, and writes memory frames to disk. It also executes the user-shutdown macro if present for custom cleanup procedures. This prevents data corruption and ensures a clean system state."}
{"instruction": "How long can I make a process sleep using the sleep command?", "input": "The sleep command suspends further processing until the specified time expression is exhausted or reached.

After the final drive in that chain fills, there is no further link, so the process reverts to normal behaviour and asks the operator to mount the next reel."}
{"instruction": "Explain why all tape drives must share the same block size (or be auto-switchable) when I use t-cascade.", "input": "Description excerpt: “All tape drives involved in the cascade must be at the same block size or be able to change to the starting drive’s block size automatically for the cascade to succeed.", "output": "During a cascade every subsequent drive receives data that was framed for the first drive’s block size. If a later drive cannot accept that block length, writes will fail and the cascade breaks. Requiring identical (or auto-negotiated) block sizes guarantees that each linked device can accept the incoming data stream without errors."}
{"instruction": "I need to copy only the first account from a multi-account save on tape. How would I do that with t-copy?", "input": "Syntax: t-copy source.device dest.device {(file.count}\nParameter excerpt: “file.count specifies the number of file segments; a save format uses 2 + 1 per account, so the first account is file count 3.\nExample: t-copy 0 2 (3", "output": "Attach both devices, then execute ➜  t-copy 0 2 (3  — the “(3 option limits the copy to the first three file segments, which correspond to the first account in a save-format tape."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to run t-copy without specifying (file.count, and what happens if I omit it?", "input": "Syntax: t-copy … {(file.count}\nDescription: Default file count is 1.\nExample: t-copy 0 2", "output": "Yes. If you do not supply (file.count, t-copy defaults to one file segment. For instance ‘t-copy 0 2’ copies from the current block on device 0 up to the first EOF mark onto device 2."}
{"instruction": "Why must both the source and destination devices already be attached before I issue t-copy?", "input": "Parameter note: “Both source and destination devices must be attached to the current process.", "output": "t-copy operates entirely within the current D3 process; the command has no built-in mechanism to attach devices on-the-fly. If either device is unattached, the process cannot read from or write to it, and the copy fails. Attaching ahead of time ensures both channels are open and correctly configured."}
{"instruction": "Give me a one-liner that dumps only invoices dated on or before 1 Jan 2005, and labels the tape accordingly.", "input": "Syntax: t-dump file.reference {selection.criteria} {heading \"text\"}\nExample: t-dump invoices with date <= \"1/1/05\" heading \"Pre-2005 archived invoices\"", "output": "t-dump invoices with date <= \"1/1/05\" heading \"Pre-2005 archived invoices\""}
{"instruction": "Why does t-dump prompt for another reel, and what choices do I have when it does?", "input": "Description excerpt: “In multireel operations the process detects end of media and prompts: insert next reel — press c to continue or q to quit.", "output": "When the current reel reaches physical end-of-media, t-dump cannot continue writing. It pauses and issues the prompt. At that point you may:\n• Mount a new reel and type **c** to carry on dumping, or\n• Type **q** to abandon the dump and return to TCL."}
{"instruction": "Explain the purpose of the t-dump ‘a’ option and when I should use it.", "input": "Parameter excerpt: ‘a – makes backward-compatible tapes.’", "output": "Use the **(a** option when the target system is an older release that expects the earlier tape label format. It forces t-dump to write a backward-compatible header so the tape is readable by legacy Pick/D3 environments."}
{"instruction": "What does t-eod actually do to the tape device?", "input": "Description: “The t-eod command moves a tape forward to the end of the recorded data.”\nExample output shows END OF RECORDED DATA.", "output": "t-eod issues consecutive reads until it encounters two successive tape file marks (the logical end-of-data), positioning the device just beyond the last written block. The drive is now ready for appending new files without overwriting existing data."}
{"instruction": "I ran t-eod and saw “BLOCK SIZE: 16896   [92] END OF RECORDED DATA – 3 FILE(S)”. What do those numbers mean?", "input": "Example output: BLOCK SIZE: 16896  … END OF RECORDED DATA – 3 FILE(S)", "output": "• 16896 = the block length (bytes) of the data already on the tape.\n• 3 FILE(S) = three file marks (three logical files) were crossed before reaching the physical end-of-data."}
{"instruction": "Can t-eod be used on any Pick-formatted media, or only on streaming cartridge tape?", "input": "Description states it simply moves the tape to end of recorded data; no media restrictions are listed.", "output": "t-eod is generic: it works on whatever Pick-formatted medium is attached (SCT, DAT, ½-inch, pseudo-floppy, etc.) because it relies only on reading blocks until it sees end-of-file markers."}
{"instruction": "How would I clear existing links on tape device 4 so it starts prompting again at end-of-tape?", "input": "Syntax: t-link device.num,… {option}\nParameter: option c — clears all links for the first device number specified.\nExample: t-link 4 (c", "output": "Execute ➜  t-link 4 (c  — the (c option removes any cascade/loop information for device 4, restoring normal EOT prompting."}
{"instruction": "Is there any functional difference between t-link and t-cascade?", "input": "Description snippet (identical wording in both commands).", "output": "No. t-link is an alias of t-cascade; both commands update the tape-link table in the same way. The choice is stylistic."}
{"instruction": "Why is block-size consistency still important when I use t-link to chain drives?", "input": "Description: “All tape drives involved … must be at the same block size.”", "output": "Because data streaming continues unchanged from one drive to the next, any mismatch in block length would make the receiving drive reject or mis-interpret the blocks. Ensuring identical (or auto-adjustable) block sizes prevents write errors and guarantees data integrity across the chain."}
{"instruction": "After a multi-reel backup I have an unlabeled tape positioned at the correct file mark. How do I restore it without a label?", "input": "Syntax: t-load … (options\nDescription: If the tape is unlabeled t-load backspaces one block but you must have set the correct block size via t-att.", "output": "Use t-att to set the block size first, then issue t-load with no selection criteria. Because the tape lacks a label, t-load recognises that on its first read, back-spaces, and proceeds to load the data as long as the block size is correctly set."}
{"instruction": "What does the (o option do in t-load and when should I use it?", "input": "Parameter: o — overwrites existing items when duplicate IDs exist.", "output": "Include (o whenever you expect some of the item-IDs already exist in the target file and you want the tape copy to replace them. Without (o, duplicates raise error 223 and the items are skipped unless you also use (m to suppress that message."}
{"instruction": "If I only want to verify what would be restored without changing the file system, can t-load help?", "input": "Parameter: v — reads items but does not write them.", "output": "Yes. Run t-load … (v to read every record into memory, ensuring the tape and selection criteria are correct, while leaving the on-disk file untouched. Combine with (o to preview duplicate handling (items are still not written when v is present)."}
{"instruction": "How do I display blocks 100-120 on the attached tape in hex?", "input": "Syntax: t-read {options}\nParameter: block.number{-block.number} plus x to display in hexadecimal.", "output": "t-read 100-120 (x    — reads that block range and prints each block in hexadecimal format."}
{"instruction": "Why does t-read pause after each page, and how can I suppress that behaviour?", "input": "Parameter: n — no pause.", "output": "By default the command stops at the end of every terminal page so you can inspect the output. Add the (n option (or just n in the option list) to disable paging and let the dump scroll continuously."}
{"instruction": "Can t-read convert an EBCDIC-labelled tape to ASCII on-the-fly?", "input": "Parameter: a — converts EBCDIC to ASCII.", "output": "Yes. Use the a option: e.g. t-read (a  — every block is translated from EBCDIC before display or spooling."}
{"instruction": "I have several floppy drives and want to attach the 3.5-inch low-density unit without looking up its number. How?", "input": "Syntax: t-select {device.num}|{keyword} {(options}\nExample list shows ‘t-select 720k’.", "output": "Use the media keyword that appears in the Type/Density column, e.g. t-select 720k. The command scans the device list for a 720 KB 3.5-inch floppy and attaches the first match."}
{"instruction": "Why do I sometimes get “Device does not exist, create it?” when running t-select?", "input": "Description: If the pseudo floppy does not exist the command prompts.", "output": "When you reference a pseudo-floppy filename (or keyword mapped to one) that hasn’t been defined in the configuration, t-select offers to create the placeholder device definition. Answering ‘y’ adds the entry so it can be attached next time."}
{"instruction": "Explain the purpose of the (w option in t-select.", "input": "Parameter: w — prevents an automatic rewind on the device.", "output": "When you intend to perform multiple operations at different file marks you can prevent the drive from rewinding on close by attaching it with (w. That leaves the tape positioned where your previous command stopped."}
{"instruction": "I need to advance exactly four file marks and read the labels as I go. Which command and syntax should I use?", "input": "Syntax: t-space {number}\nExample prompt: t-space no. of files? 4", "output": "Run ➜ t-space 4  — the process moves forward four file marks and echoes each label it meets."}
{"instruction": "What happens if I issue t-space with no number argument?", "input": "Parameter: number — required; if not specified the process stops and indicates that a count is required.", "output": "The command immediately returns an error message asking for a count, and no motion occurs. You must supply the numeric argument (e.g. t-space 1) for the tape to move."}
{"instruction": "Is t-space capable of skipping backwards?", "input": "Description only mentions moving forward.", "output": "No. t-space is forward-only; to move backward you must rewind or re-attach, depending on the drive’s capabilities."}
{"instruction": "How would I display the last five lines of three items (hot-backup, network-setup, nt_pinfo) including item-IDs?", "input": "Syntax: tail filename item.list {(options}\nExample: tail dm,bp, hot-backup network-setup nt_pinfo (i5", "output": "tail dm,bp, hot-backup network-setup nt_pinfo (i5  — the (i option prints the Item-ID and 5 tells tail to return five trailing lines (plus one extra line by design)."}
{"instruction": "Why does tail actually return n+1 lines when I ask for n?", "input": "Parameter note: “number of lines returned will actually be the specified number plus 1.”", "output": "tail deliberately includes the terminating line break of the preceding line for context, so you see the last **n** full lines plus one extra blank or partial line above them."}
{"instruction": "Can I suppress both item-IDs and line numbers in tail output?", "input": "Options: i displays IDs; s suppresses line numbers.", "output": "Yes. Omit (i and add (s: e.g. tail dict,messages * (s5  — item-IDs are not printed and line numbers are hidden."}
{"instruction": "Give me the command to attach my current session to port 13 so I can watch what that user is doing.", "input": "Syntax: tandem port.number {(options}\nExample: tandem 13", "output": "tandem 13  — your session becomes the master; all input/output on port 13 is echoed to you and vice-versa until the hot-key sequence disconnects."}
{"instruction": "How can I customise the disconnect sequence to the characters *++ when using tandem?", "input": "Option d — designates up to four hex values.\nExample: tandem 33 (d/2a,2b,2b", "output": "Include the **(d/** option followed by the hex codes: 0x2A is ‘*’ and 0x2B is ‘+’. For example:\n```\ntandem <port> (d/2a,2b,2b\n```"}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of the (n option in tandem?", "input": "Option n — turns on the tandem capability for the current port.", "output": "(n enables other users to tandem into your port. Until it is set, attempts by another port to link to yours are denied."}
{"instruction": "How do I run the TCL command `count md` on port 33 if that port is logged in as user dm?", "input": "Syntax: tcl port.number user-ID tcl.commands {(options)}\nExample: tcl 33 dm count md", "output": "tcl 33 dm count md  — the command suspends the process on port 33, pushes a level, and executes `count md`. The output appears on both port 33 and your own port."}
{"instruction": "Why would I choose tcls over tcl for remote execution?", "input": "Description: tcls suppresses the messages generated by the command that was executed on the remote port.", "output": "Use **tcls** when you only want the results to appear on the remote port, not echoed back to yours. This is helpful for silent administrative jobs where your own screen noise should stay minimal."}
{"instruction": "How can I stop spooled reports from printing the TCL that generated them?", "input": "Syntax: tcl-hdr {(options}\nOption f — toggles off the default header.", "output": "tcl-hdr (f  — future jobs sent to the spooler will no longer include a TCL header on page 1."}
{"instruction": "tcl-hdr keeps telling me whether the header is active. Can I suppress that status message?", "input": "Option s — suppresses output of the status message.", "output": "Add **(s**: e.g. tcl-hdr (fs  or tcl-hdr (ns). The command still changes the setting but prints nothing."}
{"instruction": "If I change my mind, how do I re-enable the header later on?", "input": "Option n — toggles header on.", "output": "Run tcl-hdr (n  — the header is again printed at the top of spooler reports."}
{"instruction": "What exactly does the term command’s fd parameter control when I set it to 0 versus 2?", "input": "Parameter description for fd.", "output": "fd dictates both page-eject behaviour and the number of nulls sent after a form-feed:\n• 0 – suppresses page ejects for terminal **and** printer; pads with a single LF.\n• 2 or more – normal mode: clears the screen/ejects a page and outputs that many nulls."}
{"instruction": "How would I switch my terminal type to wy-50 and immediately recompile its definition?", "input": "Syntax: term tt {(options)}\nExample: term wy-50 (c", "output": "term wy-50 (c  — ‘(c’ forces recompilation of the wy-50 driver from dm,devices, before activating it."}
{"instruction": "Is there a quick way to display my current terminal settings without changing anything?", "input": "Option r — redisplays resulting term parameters after changing (but you can leave all numeric fields null).", "output": "term ,,,,,,,,, (r  — by leaving every positional argument empty you change nothing; (r then echoes the existing width, depth, etc."}
{"instruction": "When would I use termu instead of term?", "input": "Description: termu automatically updates width/depth from the UNIX stty.", "output": "Choose **termu** when your window size changes (e.g. an xterm resize). termu reads the current stty rows/columns and adjusts the Pick terminal width/depth automatically, whereas term requires you to type the new numbers manually."}
{"instruction": "Explain how termu combines ls and td when I supply both values.", "input": "Parameter note: ‘td is added to ls and must equal the actual number of lines on the terminal.’", "output": "The line-skip (ls) defines how many blank lines appear at the bottom of the screen; terminal depth (td) defines the visible rows above that. termu sums them to get the total physical line count, ensuring cursor control operations stay within the real screen size."}
{"instruction": "Can I use termu to apply a keyboard translation table for an IBM 3151 terminal?", "input": "Option k — sets I/O translation; example: term ibm3151 (k", "output": "Yes. For example: termu ibm3151 (k  — this sets tt to ibm3151, loads its keyboard translation table, and updates width/depth at the same time."}
{"instruction": "How can I disable the time and date display at the TCL prompt?", "input": "timedate {(options)}\n\nThe timedate command sets or displays the status of the time and date display.\n\nParameter(s):\noptions\nfTurns off to suppress display of time/date at TCL.\nnTurns on to display the time/date at TCL.

{"instruction": "Is it possible to check the current status of time/date display using the timedate command?", "input": "The timedate command sets or displays the status of the time and date display. If no option is provided, the current status is shown.", "output": "Yes, if you run the timedate command without any options, it displays the current status of the time and date display at TCL."}
{"instruction": "Give me an example of turning the time/date display back on after disabling it.", "input": "Example(s):\ntimedate (f[1307] The time-date display is off.\ntimedate (n[1306] The time-date display is on.", "output": "To re-enable the time/date display after turning it off, use:\ntimedate (n"}
{"instruction": "When would I want to use the 's' option with the timedate command?", "input": "Parameter(s):\noptions\nsSuppresses output of the status message.", "output": "You might use the 's' option when you want to run the timedate command silently, without displaying a status message. This is useful in scripts or automation contexts where clean output is important."}
{"instruction": "How would I inspect the current state of the transaction log queue without any filtering?", "input": "tlqdisplay (options)\n\nThe tlqdisplay command allows you to display the transactions within the transaction queue used by both the D3 Transaction Logger and Hot Backup components.\n\nIf no options are specified, the transaction log queue displays, listing this information:\nTNo: Logical transaction number\nFrame: Frame ID in hex\nOset: Offset in hex\nT: Transaction type\nFOF#: File-of-files number\nData: First part of the optional data", "output": "To inspect the full current state of the transaction log queue without filtering, simply run:\ntlqdisplay\nThis displays a list of current transactions with associated metadata like logical transaction number, frame ID, offsets, transaction types, and data."}
{"instruction": "What does the 'c' option do in the tlqdisplay command and when should I be cautious using it?", "input": "Parameter(s):\nc - Performs a linkage check on the transaction log queue to verify the integrity of the queue.\nWarning: This option locks the transaction queue during processing, so use it with care if the queue is large.", "output": "The 'c' option verifies the integrity of the transaction log queue by performing a linkage check. However, it locks the transaction queue during this operation, so caution is advised, especially if the queue is large, to avoid system contention or delays."}
{"instruction": "Under what conditions should I use the 'mn' option with tlqdisplay?", "input": "Parameter(s):\nm - Modifies the start position of the transaction queue\nn - Specifies the logical transaction number to start from\nWarning: The Hot Backup master server must be stopped before using this option.\nWarning: Ensure that master and slave servers stay in sync when modifying the log queue.", "output": "You should use the 'mn' option when you need to start the transaction log display at a specific logical transaction number. This is helpful for reviewing a subset of the log. However, ensure the Hot Backup master server is stopped and that synchronization is maintained across master/slave systems."}
{"instruction": "Can I retrieve only a portion of the transaction data using tlqdisplay?", "input": "Parameter(s):\nd - When used with the 'm' option, displays a portion of the transaction data.", "output": "Yes, if you combine the 'd' and 'm' options, you can limit the display to a portion of the transaction data. This is useful for partial inspection when full data isn't needed."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to start displaying the transaction queue from logical transaction number 6.", "input": "Example(s):\nModifies the start of the transaction queue to start at logical transaction number 6 in the queue.\ntlqdisplay (dm6", "output": "To start displaying the transaction queue from logical transaction number 6, use:\ntlqdisplay (dm6"}
{"instruction": "What’s the main purpose of using the touch command in a D3 system?", "input": "The touch BASIC program reads and rewrites all items, without changing them, in either specified files or in all files in specified accounts.\nThe main usage of this command is to force the transaction logger to enqueue for logging all items in files or in accounts, to synchronize databases across a network.", "output": "The primary purpose of the touch command is to force the transaction logger to enqueue all items from specified files or accounts. This helps synchronize distributed databases by ensuring that every item is logged without modifying its content."}
{"instruction": "Can I use the touch command to process all files in selected accounts?", "input": "Parameter(s):\na - Select all ’D\" files of an account. With the 'a' option, the specified elements are account names. All files in the specified accounts are processed.\nNote: Synonym accounts are not processed.", "output": "Yes, you can use the 'a' option with the touch command to process all 'D' files in specified accounts. For example, if you provide a list of account names, it will touch all files in each of those accounts."}
{"instruction": "When should I prefer using the 'l' option with the touch command?", "input": "options:\nl - Log only. This option bypasses the update mechanism, but places all items into the transaction log queue. This makes the touch command much faster and less abusive so long as a true update is not required.", "output": "Use the 'l' option when you only need to enqueue items for logging without actually updating them. This makes the process faster and avoids heavy I/O, which is ideal if you’re just aiming to synchronize logs without rewriting data."}
{"instruction": "Give me an example of how to use the touch command to process all items in two specific files.", "input": "Example(s):\nTouches all items in the customers and inventory files.\ntouch customers inventory", "output": "You can use the command like this:\ntouch customers inventory\nThis processes all items in the 'customers' and 'inventory' files, enqueuing them for logging."}
{"instruction": "Why should I be careful when running the touch command?", "input": "Warning: The file-defining items (D-pointers) and binary items are not processed. Due to the amount of data being written, this command can be very intrusive.", "output": "You should be careful with the touch command because it rewrites a large amount of data, which can be resource-intensive and intrusive to the system. It’s best to avoid running it during peak hours or without verifying the scope."}
{"instruction": "How does the trap command help in handling UNIX signals within D3?", "input": "The trap BASIC program allows a TCL command (signal handler) to be executed when receiving a specific signal.\nBy default, signal handlers are set for the whole virtual machine. When it is preferable to differentiate the signal handlers depending on the user or account, a FlashBASIC program, a Proc, or an environ script must be provided to execute commands selectively.", "output": "The trap command enables you to set up signal handlers in D3, allowing TCL commands to be triggered when certain UNIX signals are received. It helps handle process-level events like alarms, timeouts, or power failures gracefully within the system."}
{"instruction": "Explain how to set a custom handler for the 'tdmon' signal on a specific pib.", "input": "Syntax:\ntrap {pib{pib.no}} {[*|signame] {[?|default|command]}}\n\nParameter:\n'pib {pib.no}' allows specifying a handler on a per-pib basis.\n'signame': tdmon - Represents tandem on.\nYou can assign a command such as 'display @(-13)tandem entered@(-14)'.", "output": "To set a custom trap for the 'tdmon' signal on PIB 49, use:\ntrap pib 49 tdmon display @(-13)tandem entered@(-14)\nThis will cause the message to be displayed in reverse video when the tandem on signal is received."}
{"instruction": "What happens if 15 TCL levels are already pushed when a signal is received?", "input": "Note: The signal handler is executed by pushing a level. If 15 TCL levels are pushed when the signal occurs, it is not processed.", "output": "If the process has already reached 15 TCL levels, additional signals will be ignored and not processed, as no more levels can be pushed for trap handlers to execute."}
{"instruction": "Give an example of how to reset all signal handlers back to their default state.", "input": "Example:\ntrap * default", "output": "To reset all signal handlers to their default configurations, use:\ntrap * default"}
{"instruction": "Why should care be taken with the 'pwr' signal in trap command usage?", "input": "Signal name: pwr — Represents power off.\nWhen an imminent power failure is detected, a SIGPWR signal is sent.\nNote: Care must be taken to synchronize the default system handler (defined in inittab) with the D3 handler.", "output": "The 'pwr' signal indicates a power-off event. It's critical to ensure proper coordination between the system-level handler (in inittab) and the D3 trap handler to prevent inconsistency or improper shutdowns during power failures."}
{"instruction": "How do I turn off the type-ahead feature on my current port?", "input": "type-ahead {(options)}\n\nThe type-ahead command enables or disables the type ahead feature for the current PIB or displays the current status if no options are provided.\n\nParameter(s):\nf - Sets the type-ahead command to Off.\nn - Sets the type-ahead command to On. This is the default.\ns - Suppresses output of the status message.", "output": "To disable type-ahead on the current port, use:\ntype-ahead (f"}
{"instruction": "Explain how type-ahead works in D3. When would it be useful?", "input": "Type-ahead buffers characters entered at a keyboard to allow for faster typing. For example: After entering a select command at TCL, a save-list command can be entered into the type-ahead buffer. When the select finishes, the save-list command is entered immediately.", "output": "Type-ahead lets you pre-type commands while the system is processing others. This is useful in high-efficiency workflows, allowing you to queue inputs without waiting for TCL prompts."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to check the current type-ahead status without changing anything?", "input": "If no options are provided, the current status of the type-ahead feature is displayed.", "output": "Yes. Running `type-ahead` without any options will show whether type-ahead is currently on or off."}
{"instruction": "Give an example of enabling type-ahead after it has been turned off.", "input": "Example(s):\ntype-ahead (n[1312] Type-ahead is on.", "output": "To re-enable type-ahead, use:\ntype-ahead (n"}
{"instruction": "What does the um command do in the D3 environment?", "input": "The um command displays the conversion units set by the set-units, set-dozens, set-decimal, or set-thousands commands.", "output": "The `um` command shows the current unit conversion settings, such as those set by commands like `set-units` or `set-decimal`. It’s used to confirm formatting preferences for numeric values."}
{"instruction": "When should I use the um command?", "input": "Use the um command to verify which unit conversion rules (like decimal or thousands formatting) are active in your session.", "output": "You should run the `um` command when you want to confirm or troubleshoot the current formatting rules applied to numerical data in your D3 session."}
{"instruction": "How do I check the current units configuration for data formatting?", "input": "Syntax:\num", "output": "To check your current unit conversion settings, simply enter:\num"}

Just type:\nunix\nThen use `exit` to return to the D3 environment."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to edit a D3 item with a UNIX editor like emacs?", "input": "Example:\nunix -2 emacs {bp my.prog}", "output": "Yes. You can use a UNIX editor like emacs to edit a D3 item by mapping it to a UNIX file. For example:\nunix -2 emacs {bp my.prog}"}
{"instruction": "Explain what happens when D3 items are passed into a UNIX command using the unix command.", "input": "During substitution of D3 items for UNIX files:\n- Attribute marks are converted to new lines\n- Groups of four spaces are converted to tabs\nThese changes are reversed when items are returned.", "output": "When D3 items are passed to UNIX, attribute marks become new lines and four spaces become tabs. After the command finishes, the formatting is converted back into D3-compatible structure."}
{"instruction": "What does the 'c' option do in the unix command?", "input": "Parameter(s):\nc - Does not convert attribute marks to new lines and vice versa.", "output": "The `c` option disables conversion between attribute marks and new lines, preserving the raw structure of D3 items during UNIX command execution."}
{"instruction": "Show me how to run the UNIX `spell` command on a D3 item and save results to another item.", "input": "Example:\nUNIX spell {ba,doc, stock.report} > {dm,pointer-file, sp}", "output": "To check spelling in a D3 item and write results into a new D3 item, use:\nUNIX spell {ba,doc, stock.report} > {dm,pointer-file, sp}"}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of the unlink-pibdev command?", "input": "The unlink-pibdev BASIC program unlinks a process from a port.\n\nThis is typically used to disconnect a process from its associated terminal I/O so it can be controlled by the calling process.
